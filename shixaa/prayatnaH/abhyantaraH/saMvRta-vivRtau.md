### उदाहरणानि
प्रयोगदशायां (न तु पाणिनीयप्रक्रियादशायाम्) अकारः। 

### भाषान्तरेषु
An [audio lecture](https://deejayvaidya.tumblr.com/post/42275194921/sanskrit-pronunciation-podcast-1-introduction) by shrI dhananjaya is valuable here (esp the comparison accross languages towards the end, though it does not include what I call the tamiL saMvRta a).

#### कैरळ्याम्
> The final /ŭ/ in the word nāḍŭ (written nāṭŭ – നാടു് = country) is called by grammarians as saṃvṛta ukāram in Malayalam and kuṯṯiyal (written kuṟṟiyal) ukaram in Tamil. This is a schwa that has evolved from the hrasva (short) /u/. The candrakkala, the halant symbol that looks like a crescent moon, is written over the hrasva ‘u’ ligature to show that the hrasva ‘u’ has become a saṃvṛta ukāram (ടു്).  In Tamil, the kuṯṯiyal ukaram is not shown in modern writing.
> 
> In the word nāṭṭukāran (നാട്ടുകാരൻ = fellow countryman) the u within the word is pronounced as a schwa, not as a full hrasva u.  But this is not shown in writing.  The pronunciation of this schwa is different from the word-final saṃvṛta ukāram such as in nāḍŭ. I understand that Kodagu (the language of Kodagu area, or Coorg) has these two kinds of schwas, the word final saṃvṛta ukāram and the schwa within words. - rAmakRShNa


#### सङ्केतिभाषा
The sanketi language (of both kaushika and beTTadapura types), aShTagrAma iyer tamiL, br̥haccaraṇa tamiL, the many KA iyengar varieties are to a great extant mutually intelligible.

The saMvRta u (basically I'd say saMvRta a) may be seen in the below excerpt (marked by *) from shrIkAnta-mUrti's translation of DVG's kagga -

> ರಾಮನಡಿಯಿಟ್ಟ ನೆಲು ಭೀಮನುಸು*ರಿನ ಖಾತು*  
ವ್ಯೋಮತಣ್ಣುಮು ಭಗೀರಥು ಕೊಳಂದ ಪುಳ  
ಸೋಮನಾ ಪೆತ್ತ ಕಡ^ಲಂಟು* ಪಳೆತಲೆಹಳಿರ  
ನಾಮ ಪುದುವ್ಹಾ^ಳಪ್ಡಿ ಮಂಕುತಿಮ್ಮ
