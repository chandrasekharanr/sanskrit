## General approach
- Steps to learning would be : listening, speaking, reading, writing .. Many options if you're determined to learn.
  - PS: Grammar translation method is a bad idea. Leads to myths about "Sanskrit is a tough language".
- Approaches for learning grammar described elsewhere.


## From zero to hero
- Samskrita Bharati conducts well designed structured programs to get you speaking in a few days. Great place to start. Find a beginners sanskrit class nearby - [India](https://www.samskritabharati.in/state/classes_prant?samskrita_bharati=Vm10amVHUXhVblJXYkdSVVlrZG9iMVJVVGtOalJteFhWVzVPVjAxWGVGbFVWbHBQVm1zeFYxWnFVbGhXUlRWTVdWZDRTbVZzVmxsaFJuQlhZa2hDZUZaSGRHRldNVnBXVFZWV2FHVnFRVGs9), USA etc..
- "The best way to learn Sanskrit is by immersing in its poetic literature after some basic grammar (for me, Karnataka State Board 8th std - 10th std first language Sanskrit grammar 1989-1992 was more than enough to easily understand Shriharsha's Naishadheeya)." - Dr R Shankar, Poet and avadhAnin
- Read 50 issues of https://sambhashanasandesha.in/ cover to cover. Take up SB correspondence course. Also read vAlmIki's rAmAyaNa cover to cover.
- A friend use lessons from chitrapur maTha to learn the basics, and then started reading shAstra-s, stotras and kAvya-s that interested him.

## Sanskrit household
- How to raise a mutlilingual kid in an environment dominated by English?
    - Use the "don't/ won't understand" policy.
