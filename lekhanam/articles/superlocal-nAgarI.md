Devanāgarī's supra-local status has historical roots in the early forms of Nāgarī and its prototypes were often used outside of north India, e.g. a script known as Nandī-nāgarī and other similar northern-style scripts were sporadically used in addition to the local scripts for writing Sanskrit in the Deccan / south India from the 7th century onwards. 

Inscriptions in early or proto-forms of Nāgarī are also found outside of India, as far as Sri Lanka, Burma & Indonesia, and the scripts, from which Devanāgarī developed, became a sacred form of writing for Buddhists in East Asia. In this sense Nāgarī does have a special status as a sort of first among the firsts among the Indic scripts. In this way, Nāgarī can be said to have played a role among scripts that is in part analogous to that of languages such as Sanskrit, Persian and English, which at various times have served as lingua franca for the pan-Indic cultural region.
