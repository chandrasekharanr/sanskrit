- "All indications are that the spoken language for which the early scripts (brahmi & kharosthi) were invented did not follow a fully scientific (or standardized) mapping of sounds to script, so the early scripts did not allow for phonetically accurate representation of the spoken language. In fact the kharosthi script in its early centuries did not even show vowel length distinctions but this is no evidence to show that the underlying spoken Indo-Aryan language in the 4th century BCE had shed its all its long vowels. It is only an evidence that the script did not allow such vowel length distinctions to be orthographically represented (until that script evolved enough over the centuries to allow fully phonetic representation of the spoken language -- and voila, you have phonetically accurate sanskrit appearing after centuries of apparent written "prakrit" -- when really all that had happened is only that the script had evolved, not so much the spoken language)."
