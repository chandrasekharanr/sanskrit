## Early inadequacy
- "All indications are that the spoken language for which the early scripts (brahmi & kharosthi) were invented did not follow a fully scientific (or standardized) mapping of sounds to script, so the early scripts did not allow for phonetically accurate representation of the spoken language."
- "In fact the kharosthi script in its early centuries did not even show vowel length distinctions but this is no evidence to show that the underlying spoken Indo-Aryan language in the 4th century BCE had shed its all its long vowels. It is only an evidence that the script did not allow such vowel length distinctions to be orthographically represented (until that script evolved enough over the centuries to allow fully phonetic representation of the spoken language -- and voila, you have phonetically accurate sanskrit appearing after centuries of apparent written "prakrit" -- when really all that had happened is only that the script had evolved, not so much the spoken language)." [रामकृष्णः](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/e26Gh14ohxI)
- Even in later scripts, there is problem writing तल्ँ लाति (for तल्लाँति). 

## Later script degeneracy
In many medieval and modern scripts, vargIya-panchama-s stopped being used - substituted by anusvAra-s. In Hindi, anusvAra also came to be used in place of anunAsika - as in हैँ. Also in Hindi, is written as हैं though pronounced as हॆँ (similar with मैं). 

Further, there is the schwa-deletion phenomenon.

There is also the lazy visarga syndrome - the regular visarga (or even colon) being substituted for jihvAmUlIya and upadhmAnIya.

### Alveolars in maLayALam
Meanings change in Malayalam as the sound changes from retroflex to alveolar and to dental:  
Kuṭṭi (retroflex ṭ) = child, Kuṯṯi (alveolar ṯ) = a stake, a bolt etc., Kutti (dental t) = past tense of kuttŭ meaning stabbed, pricked, etc, Paṇi (retroflex ṇ) = work, Paṉi (alveolar ṉ) = fever, dew.  

How do you write alveolar ṯ and alveolar ṉ  in maLayaLam script? 
The last and first of this - https://i.imgur.com/bcYUI4j.png . "Alveolar ṉ existed as a character distinct from dental n till about the second half of the 1800s, but was discarded under the logic that a Malayali can easily tell when to pronounce n as dental or as alveolar.  Not a wise move, like the discarding of the samvrta ukaara in the 1970 - 1980 period." Unvoiced alveolar ṯ occurs only in the geminate (double) form and is represented as double hard ṟṟ (റ്റ).

### Failed attempt to retard Grantha
- "See [Tamil Tribune archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20200306030655/http://www.tamiltribune.com/18/1201.html) and its 5 references at the bottom. I think first their concern was with the proposal to add Grantha letters to the Tamil block. Fine, so it was created as a separate block, as "not Tamil". Then there was also a serious protest when it was proposed to add letters like short-e to the Grantha block! The fear seems to have been that if Grantha becomes a strict superset of Tamil, then people may actually use it instead. So even though Grantha is not "their script", they still want to keep it crippled so that one cannot write Tamil using the script."
