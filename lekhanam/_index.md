## Whitespace conventions
### No spacing
- Pre 1800 manuscripts did not use whitespaces.
- Rarely, one sees people following this convention.
- उज्ज्वलराजपुत्रेण स्थूलाक्षरैर् पदभेदद्योतनं रुचिरम्! "**स**र्वमि**दं**स**त्य**म्महोदय। **कि**न्तु**याद्य**जनभाषाहि**न्दी**त्यु**च्य**ते**सा**प्राक्तनसंस्कृतनिष्ठभा**षा**याः hyper-persianization क्रि**या**याः**फ**ल**मित्य**पि**नवि**स्मरेम। "

### Some spacing
Here space is avoided in case of most sandhis (makAra to anusvAra being an exception), but is introduced everywhere else between pada-s.  This is popular with the advent of printing.

### Extra spacing
- I _sometimes_ like to follow the convention shown here: "व्याख्यातुं कुशलाः केचिद् ग्रन्थान् धारयितुम् परे॥". Whatever helps the reader.

#### Objection to uniformity
An objection I've come across multiple times is as follows: "As I had indicated to you earlier, the break up of words is fine for your conversational exchanges, news reoprting, indology word analysis, personal study, and to teach students, but not for the original texts. They should not be disturbed."

To this, my response is to note as follows: If you want to "keep it original" - you should remove EVERY bit of whitespace (and even very many avagrahas) - that was how all indian scripts were written 200 years ago as may be verified from palm leaf manuscripts. There is no shAstra requiring me to follow some arbitrary, modern and inconsistent rule for breaking up words. As such my personal convenience trumps such shaky conventions.
