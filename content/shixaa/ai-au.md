- "By the time of patanjali (classical saMskRta) the ए ओ were monophthongs, but ऐ औ were diphthongs. We know this because patanjali describes this. I don't know about the RgvedaprAtishAkhya or the Rktantra - they would be prior to patanjali, but also when classical sanskrit had come to be spoken... patanjali (already classical) mentions that people from the राणायणीय stream pronounced a short version of ए. A short length vowel pretty much cannot be a diphthong. If this sect had been pronouncing a short version of ए since ancient times, that would argue against a diphthong ए." 
- "In Pāṇini's time the *āi > ai & *ai > e (also *āu > au & *au > o) chain shifts had not yet happened in sanskrit (which with its several dialects, was the commonly spoken bhāṣā of the day, even after being standardised by Pāṇini). Also to the redactors of the Pali canon who (living not too distant from Pāṇini in time) were very likely not schooled in phonetics or morphology, the *āi and *ai would have sounded too similar to need separate akṣaras in the script so both were represented by the same letter 𑀏 (brāhmī symbol for 'e'). Thus while devaiḥ was pronounced *daivāiḥ by Pāṇini, it was pronounced in much the same way by the redactors of the pali canon, but written as devehi (where both e were expected to approximate the unified ai phoneme of the unschooled person."  - [रामकृष्णः BVP](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/lcEX598u_Jc/iYkcS4aeAQAJ)
