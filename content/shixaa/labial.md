## v: labial or dento-labial
### Phonetic drift
> It could have been a bi-labial ; but we have no positive proof to that effect. .... Siddheshwar  Varma ( 1929), p. 129, says: " For at least a thousand years before  Brugmann, Indian grammarians had observed, and correctly, that the  Sanskrit v in the medial and final positions was not a labio-dental." The  Dantyoṣṭhyavidhi , p. 4, provides lists of variation between pure labial and  labio-dental varieties of v and b in the Atharvaveda . It may be argued  that the euphonic alternation of v with the pure labial u, and its dialectal  and historical relationship with the pure labial b in Sanskrit suggest its  predominant feature of labiality. It is possible that gradually the dental articulator entered the pronunciation of v to keep it distinct from b which  is bi-labial.

> ... it is difficult to agree with  Whitney that this v in Sanskrit is a spirant , since no text in Indian  phonetics has included v in the class of spirants ( ūṣman ).

### Classification in classical times
> Like the Prãtiśãkhyas , (Panini) probably considered teeth to be the articulator of v , thus leading to a pure labial point of articulation classification for v.
> 
> ... Somehow the Pāninīya-śikṣā came to elevate danta " teeth " from their usually accepted karaṇa " articulator " status to the status of sthãna "point of articulation " in the case of v .
>
> ... Probably the Pāninīya śikṣã, a creation of post-Patañjali era, influenced Candragomin, the Cãndra-varṇa-sūtras. Influence of Candragomin on the a Kãiśkã-vr̥tti is an accepted opinion. ... The argument of the Kãkikã-vr̥tti is blindly followed by the later tradition of the Pãninian scholars, and this was accelerated by the growing reverence for the Pãniniya-śikṣā.
