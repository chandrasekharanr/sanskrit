CHAPTER I

A TRADITIONAL list (of words) has been handed down (to us). It is to be (here) explained. This same list is called Ni-ghantavas.1 

From what (root) is (the word) Ni-ghantavas derived? They are words quoted fromthe Vedas (ni-gamaih)? Having been repeatedly gathered together3 fromVedic hymns, they have been handed down by tradition. Aupamanyava holds that, as these are the quoted words of the Vedas, they are called Ni ghantavas on account of their being quoted (t/ii-gamanaat). 

Or else (the word Ni-ghantavas) may be (so called) from being fixed only (Vhan), i.e. (a list.in which) they (the words) are fixed together, or collected together ( Vhr).

Now, what (are) the four classes 4 of words ? They are the following : noun and verb ; prepositions and particles. 

With reference to this, they6 thus prescribe the definition of noun and verb : the verb has becoming as its fundamental notion,6 nouns have being as their fundamental notion.7 

But where both are dominated by becoming,/a becoming arising from a former to a later state is denoted by a verb, as 'he goes ', he cooks *,8 &c. 

The embodiment of the whole process from the beginning to the end, which has assumed the character of being, is denoted by a noun, as' going ',' cook ing ', &c.

[^6]: MODIFICATIONS OF BECOMING [1. i

The demonstrative pronoun 1 is a reference to beings, as' cow ', ' horse *,' man ',' elephant ', &c. ; 2 ' to be ', to becoming, as 'he sits', 'he sleeps',* 'he goes ',' he stands ', &c.

According to Audumbarayana speech is permanent in the organs only.3

### 

In that case the fourfold division (of words) will not hold good, nor the grammatical, connexion, nor the mutual reference of sounds which are not produced simultaneously.5 Words are used to designate objects, with regard to everyday affairs in the world, on account of-their comprehensive

ness and minuteness. They, too, are the names of gc as well as of human beings.7 On account of the impermanence of human Uaowledge, the stanza, (directing) the accomplishment of action, is (to be found) in the Veda.8

According to Varsyayani, there are six modifications of becoming : genesis, existence, alteration, growth, decay, and destruction.9 Genesis denotes only the commencement of the first state, but neither affirms nor denies the later. Existence affirms a being that has been produced. Altera tion connotes the modification of elements of a non-decaying being.10 Growth denotes the increase of one's own limbs or of objects which are associated (with one's self), as he grows by means of victory, or he grow.s with his

Hence, other modifications of becoming are only further developments of those (enumerated above), and should be inferred according to the occasion. 'Unconnected prepositions', says 6akatayana, 'have no meaning, butonly express a subordinate sense of nouns and verbs.' l ' They have various meanings,' says Gargya ;' hence, whatever their meaning may be, theyexpress that meaning (which brings about) modification in the sense of the noun and the verb.' - The word a is used in the sense of ' hitherward '; 3 pro, and puroi are its antitheses : abhi* ' towards ' ; prati is its antithesis : ati and su,' apj val' ; nir and dur are their antitheses : ni and ava, * downwards '; ud is their antithesis : sum,' combination '; vi and apa are its antitheses : ai'.u,' similarity' and ' succession': api^' contact': upa, 1 accession': pari,' being all around': adhi,' being above ', or' supremacy '. 5 Thus they express various meanings to which attention should be paid.6 (Here ends the third section.)

Now the particles occur in various senses,7 both in a comparative sense, in a conjunctive sense,8 and as expletives. Of them, the following four are used in the sense of comparison.8 Iva (has this sense) both in the classical and in the Vedic Sanskrit : thus ' like Agni ',* like Indra ', &c.

Jndra as a god V it has the sense of negation.2 The established use is (to place it immediately) before that which it makes negative. In the passage 'Lake hard drinkers of wine',3 it has the sense of comparison. The estab ii shed use is (to place it immediately) after that with which it compares. The word cid has many meanings. In the sentence ' Will the teacher kindly explain it ?' it is used in the (sense of) respect, [from what root is (the word) dcdrya derived ?]* A-cdrya (teacher) is so called because he imparts traditional precepts (d-cdra) ; 6 or because he systematically arranges (a + y/cl + artha) the various objects (of knowledge), or because he systematic ally develops the intellectual faculty.6 In the expression like curd ', it ft used in the sense of comparison ; in ' bring even the sour gruel ', it is Used in the sense of contempt. Kul-md$dk (sour gruels) are so called because they are wasted away (sldaidi) in families (kulesu).1 The word TVu has many meanings. In the sentence ' therefore he will do it ', it is Used in assigning a reason ; in ' how pray will he do it ?' in asking a ques tion, as well as in ' has he really done it ?' It is also used in the sense of

comparison (as follows) :

Ot? thee like the branches of a tree, O widely invoked one! * Of thee like the branches of a tree, O widely invoked one ! "Vaydh means branches, (and) is derived from (the root) vi (to move) : they paove in the wind.9 tid-khdh (branches) are so called because they rest in trhe sky (kha-saydh), or (the word) may be derived from (the root) auk (to be able).9 Now a conjunctive particle is that by whose addition separateness of notions is indeed recognized, but not like an enumerative one, i.e. because of a separation by isolation.10 The word ca is used in the sense of ' aggre gation ', and is joined together with both, as' I and you, O slayer of Vrtra I' " d is used in the same sense, as' for gods and for manes V* The word vd is Used in the sense of deliberation, as' Ah, shall I put this earth here or there? >K! ^Moreover, it is used in the sense of ' aggregation' (as follows).

' Vayu and thee, Mann and thee.' l The words aha and hi have the sense of * mutual opposition ', and are combined with the former (member) as' let this man do this, the other that ', and * this man will do this, not that ', &c. The letter u is also used in the same sense, (being joined) with the later (member], as < these people tell a lie, those the truth'; it is further used as an expletive, as 'this', 'that'. The word Id has many meanings in (the sentence) 'therefore he will do it', it (is used) to point out the reason ; in (the sentence)' how pray will he do it V to ask a question ; in (the sentence) 'how can he analyse it ?' to (indicate) displeasure. The word kild (is used to express.) superiority of knowledge, as' thus truly it happened '.

Moreover, it is combined with the two (particles) wt and mi uu in asking a question, as' was it not so ?' and ' was it so, pray ?' The word iita denotes prohibition, as' do not do it ', and ' do not take '. The word kfudu alsoj (denotes prohibition), as' enough of doing this ', and ' have done with it' J f urther, it is used as an expletive, as' thus it happened '. The word satiwit lias the sense of uncertainty in classical Sanskrit : (in the sentence)' was it ever so V it (is used) in an interrogation ; (in the sentence)' was it ever so pray ?' in an interrogation but not to oneself. The word nunam has the sense of uncertainty in the classical language, both, i.e. the sense of uncertainty and that of an expletive, in Vedic Sanskrit.2

May that rich reward of thine, O Indra ! milk every boon for the singer. Be helpful to the worshippers, do not put us aside, let good fortune (corne) to us ; may we speak loudly in the assembly with heroes.3

May that (reward) of thine milk every boon for the singer. Boon, what is to be chosen. Singer, praiser. Rich reward, i. e. abounding in wealth. The word magham is a synonym of wealth, it is derived from (the root) mamh, meaning to give.4 Daksina (reward) is derived from (thu root) daka, meaning to cause to accomplish : it causes the imperfect to be accomplished. Or else, it may be (so called) from circumambulating. With reference to the quarter, (it means) the quarter natural to the hand, i.e. the right hand.6 Daksinah (right) is derived from (the root) daks, meaning to work strenuously, or from das, meaning to give. IJastah (hand) is derived from (the root) han (to strike): it is quick to strike. Fulfil the desires of the worshippers. Do not pass us over, do not give, leaving us aside. Let good fortune be for us. May we speak loudly in our own assembly. Bhaya (good fortune) is derived from (the root) bhaj (*A> distribute).6 The word brhat is a synonym of ' great': it is grown all round. Having heroes, or having blessed heroes, A hero, he disperses (vi-irayati) the enemies, or it (w-ra) may be derived from (the root) vf. meaning to go, or from mr (to be powerful).7

[^1]: Explained by Durga as an offspring of became the southern quarter. The expression, u low-class man who lives in various ways,' natural to the hand ', is to be understood or who is not to be brought to the assembly as being pointed out by the right hand of the good. while cne faces the eastern direction.

The word aim has the sense of totality, or is (used) as an expletive : l Aditya sent them forth.2

Sent them forth, i. e. sent them forth on all sides. And also : From all sidas the wise one has manifested bright rays.B

i. e. The sun has uncovered (them) on all sides. 8u-Wtfah means the raysof the sun, (so called) on account of their brilliant light (su-rocaua). Or else the word sima takes the ablative suffix (-tas) without any meaning,i.e. sliniiah = slmatalt = simd-tah, (which means)* from the boundary '. tiwnd means boundary: it forms the seam between two countries. Theword tva, being a pronoun with the sense of ' opposition ', is unaccented.Some hold it to be a synonym of ' half '.

One sits increasing the store of stanzas ; a second chants the yayatrahymn in vakvari measures. One, i. e. Brahma, expounds the science ofbeing ; whilst another metes the measure of the sacrifice.4

With these words, (the stanza) declares the application of the duties ofthe priests. One sits increasing the store of stanzas, i. e. the invoker.A stanza (re) is a means of worshipping (arcana). A second chants theyayatra hymn in Zakvarl- measures, i. e. the chanter. Gdyatram is derivedfrom (the root) yai, meaning to praise. Sakvaryah are stanzas ; it is derived from (the root) &uk (to .be able). It is known : because with thesehe was able to slay Vrtra, that is the characteristic of the &alwari stanzas.5 One, i. e. the Brahma, expounds the science of every being. Brahma is omniscient: he knows everything; Brahma is supererninent from know ledge, Brahma is supereminent all around. One metes the measure of thesacrifice, i. e. the (performing) priest. Adhvar-yuh (priest) = adhvara-yuh,i. e. he directs the sacrifice, he is the leader of the sacrifice, or else, he lovesthe sacrifice. Or (the word is formed) by the addition of (the suffix) yuh(to Vadhi) in the sense of studying. A-dhvara is a synonym of ' sacrifice' : the verb dhvr means to kill, (a-dhvara denotes) the negation of it (killing). According to some, the word (tva) is a particle, then how could it be a nounof unaccented character ? It is clearly inflected. ' Lo ! they call thee,

[Friends], having (similar) eyes and ears. Aksih (eye; is derived from (the root) caks (to see) ;' it is from ailj (to be beautiful),' says Agrayana. It is well known: Therefore, they are, as it were, more beautiful.4 Karnah (ear) is derived from (the root) krt (to cut) : it has its entrance torn asunder ;' it is from r (to go)/ says Agrayana. It is well known : Going upwards, as it were, they have protruded in space.4 They were unequal in the speed of their minds. Some reach up to the mouth, others up to the breast. 5 Asyam 6 (mouth) is derived from (the root) as (to throw), or else (from d-syand,' to flow ') : food flows towards it. Dagh'iiam is derived from (the root) dagh, meaning to flow, or from das (to be wasted) : it is very much wasted. Some are like tanks, suitable for bathing. Suitable for bathing, i. e. fit for bathing ; (others are) to be seen only.7 Hradah (tank) is derived from (the root) hrdd, meaning to make a sound, or from hldd, meaning to make cool. Further, it (tva) is used in the sense of ' aggregation ', as' recurrences and possession of As*vins'; 8i. e. possession of As'vins, and recurrences. Now the words which are used the sense being complete to fill up a sentence in prose, and a verse in poetic compositions, are expletives such as fawn-, lm, id, and it.9

Hell is going downwards, i. e. falling lower and lower ; or it does notcontain even slight room for happiness. Moreover the words iw. ca arejoined with the word id, in interrogation, as 'do- they not drink wine?'Surd (wine) is derived from (the root) -sw, (to press). Thus they are usedin various meanings, to which attention should be paid.5 (Here end* tJte eleventh section.)

With these words, the four word-classes, i. e. the noun and the verb,prepositions and particles, are explained in their (respective) order. Withreference to this, 6akatayana holds that nouns are derived from verbs.This, too, is the doctrine of the etymologists.6 ' Not all,' say Gargj'a and

Among the gram ynumm-ated in the gana called cadayah (op. marians, Sakatayana says, 'The noun is cit. i. 4. 57). The total number of particles derived from the verb'; cf. also Breal,collected in the list is 195. This, however, Semantics, p. 107: 'It comes from the fact docs not include cid and ki mentioned by that the vrb is the essential and the capital Yaska.

some of the grammarians,' but only those, the accent and grammatical form of which are regular and which are accompanied by an explanatory radical modification. Those (nouns), such as cow, horse, man, elephant, &c., are conventional 1 (terms, and hence are underivable).'

Now, if all nouns are derived from verbs, every person who performs a particular action should be called by the same name, i.e. whosoever runs on the road should be called 'runner' (a&va, 'horse'); whatever pricks (like needle, &c.), 'pricker' (trnam, 'grass'). Further, if all nouns are derived from verbs, a substantive should obtain as many names as

the actions with which it is connected; thus a column should also be called ' beam-supporter ', and ' that which rests in a hole '.

(Here ends the twelfth section.)

Moreover, substantives should be named according to the regular and correct grammatical form of a verb, so that their meanings may be indubitable, e.g. purusa (man) should take the form of pur!.-saya (city dweller) ; aim (horse), of astd (runner) ; triiam (grass), of tardanam (pricker). Further, people indulge in sophistry with regard to current expressions, e. g. they declare that earth (prthivi is (so called) on account of being spread (Vprath)\ but who spread it, and what was the base? Again, JSakatayana derived parts of one word from different verbs, in spite of the meaning being irrelevant, and of the explanatory radical modification being non-existent, e.g. (explaining sat-ya) he derived the later syllable ya from the causal form of (the root) i (to go), and the

former syllable sat from the regular form of (the root) as (to be). Further, it is said that a becoming is preceded by a being, (hence) the designation of a prior (being) from a posterior (becoming) is not tenable ; consequently this (theory of the derivation of nouns from verbs) is not tenable.

1.15] ARE ALL NOUNS DERIVED FROM VERBS? 15

As to (the statement) that all those (nouns), the accent and grammatical form of which are regular, and which are accompanied by an explanatory radical modification, are derived, ^we reply that) in that case it is quite evident. As to (the point) that every person whoever performs a par ticular action should be called by the same name, we see that in some cases the performers of the action do obtain a common name, while in others they do not, e. g. a carpenter or ascetic, enlivener, earth-born, Arc.1 With this, the following objection is answered as well. As to (the point) that substantives should be named in such a way that their meanings may be indubitable, (we reply that) there are words (of that character), words of rare occurrence, i.e. single words formed by primary suffixes, as creeper, guest, one having matted locks, a wanderer, wakeful, one whosacrifices with a ladle, <&c. /As to (the objection) that people indulge in sophistry with regard to current expressions, (we reply that) it is with regard to current expressions alone that (etymological) examination is most desirable. With regard to ' they declare that earth (prthivi) is (so called) on account of being spread ( V'jyrath) : but who spread it, and what was the base ?' (we reply that) it is indeed broad to look at, even if it is not spread by others. Moreover, in this way all known words, without any exception, can be found fault with. As to (the point) that a certain individual derived parts of one word from different verbs, (we reply that) the person who made such a derivation in spite of the meaning being irrelevant should be blamed; it is the fault of an individual, not of the science (of etymology).

As to (the argument) that the designation of' a prior (beiny) from a poster or becoming is not tenable, we see that in some cases prior beinga do obtain their names from posterior becomings, but not in others, as ' a woodpecker ',' one having long locks ', &c. Bllva is (so called) from being supported or from sprouting.

(Here ends the fourteenth section.)2

Moreover, without it (etymology) the precise meaning of Vedic stanzas cannot be understood. 

For one who does not understand the meaning, a thorough investigation of accent and grammatical form is not possible1. 

[^1]: The former two, i.e. a carpenter and an 2 Cf. Patanjali, op. cit. i. 1. 9, vol. i, pp. ascetic, are examples of cases where people 176-6.

16 THE KAUTSA CONTROVERSY [1. 15

hence this science (etymology) is the complement of grammar and a means of accomplishing one's own object. * 

'If (the object of the science) is to ascertain the meaning of Vedic stanzas, it is useless,' says Kautsa,' for the Vedic stanzas have no meaning';1 this is to be established' by the following arguments : 

propositions have their words fixed, their order, too, is immutably fixed.2 

Further, the accomplishment of the ritual form is enjoined by the Brahmana,3  
as ' Spread it wide ',4 and so he spreads ;'  
'Let me pour out ',6 and so he pours out. 

Further, their meaning is impossible,6 as' Save him, O plant ! ' 7  
and while striking, one declares,' Do not injure him, O Axe ! ' 8 

Moreover, their meaning is contradictory,9 as  
' There was but one Rudra and no second ',10 and ' Rudras, who on earth are thousands without number '; 11  
'O Indra! thou art born without a foe',12 and 'Indra vanquished hundred armies together'.13 

Further, one enjoins a person who is already acquainted, as ' Address the hymn to-Agni which is being kindled '. 14  

Besides, it is said,' Aditi is everything '.* 'Aditi is heaven. Aditi is atmosphere,15 &c.' will be explained later on. 16 

Further, their meaning is obscure,17 as amyak,1 * yadr̥śmin,1 * jāraydyi,20 kānukā, &c.

Indeed, they declare one to be steadfast in friendship with speech, i. e. taking delight in it, and having thoroughly understood the meaning, or in friendship with gods in a delightful place ; they do not overpower him, who knows the meaning well, even in powerful debates. But that man wanders with a barren delusion, i. e. with a symbol of speech. To him (speech) does not grant desires, which are to be granted by speech. Who heard speech without fruit or flower in the abodes of gods and men, for that man speech has no fruit nor flower, or lias very little fruit or flower.

CHAPTEB II

Now (we shall deal with) etymology. With reference to this, the words,the accent and the grammatical form of which are regular and are accom panied by an explanatory radical modification, should be derived in theordinary manner. i3ut the meaning being irrelevant, and the explanatoryradical modification being non-existent, one should always examine themwith regard to their meaning, by the analogy of some (common) course ofaction. If there be no (such) analogy, one should explain them even bythe community of a (single) syijable or letter ; l but one should never (giveup the attempt at) derivation. One should not attach (too much) importanceto the grammatical form, for tllese complex formations (w'ttayah) are (often) subject to exceptions. One should interpret inflected cases according tothe meaning. In prattam (= pra-dattam, 'given away') and avattam{ = ava-dattam from ava */do,' divided ') only the initial parts of the rootsurvive. Further, there is aphaeresis of the initial part of the verb Us(to be) in weak forms, as stah ('they two are'), santi ('they all are'), &c.Further, there is elision of the final part, as in gatvd (from Vgam,' havinggone '), yatam (Vyam, 'gone'), &c. Further, there is elision of the pen ultimate, as in jagmatuh (red. form of gam,' they two went '), and jagmuh(red. form of gam,' they all went *). 2 Moreover, there is the modification ofthe penultimate, as in raja (rdjan,' king '), dandl (dandin, a* staff-bearer '), &c. Further, there is elision of a letter, as in tatvd ydmi (= tatvdydcami), &c.

Moreover, there is elision of two letters, as in trca ( = tri + rca,' threestanzas '). Further, there is alteration in the initial part (of the root), as injyotih ( Vdynl,' light '), ghanah ( </han,l killer '), binduh ( i/bhid,' a drop '),

batyah (\/bkat, 'to be hired or nourished'), &c. Further, there is meta thesis, as in stokak (from Vscut, 'a drop'), rajjiih3 ('rope'), vikatdh*names have been long ago buried and dis-

Further, there is anaptyxis, as in dsthat (V, 'to throw'), dvdrah (Virr, 'door'), bharujd ( Vbhrajj,' ripe '. D.), &o With reference to this, it is pointed out that when a root contains a semi-vowel contiguous to a vowel it becomes the origin of two primary bases. There, if an accomplished form is not derivable from one base, one should try to derive it from the other. Even there, some are of rare occurrence, as utih (-/av,* protection '), mrduk (Vmrad, 'soft'), prthuh (^pjeath, 'broad'), prsatah (V'prua, 'a drop '), kunarum ( </kvan,' sounding '). Further, Vedic primary nouns are derived from roots of classical Sanskrit, as damundh (devoted to the house), ksetrasddhdh (one who divides the fields), &c. ; and also nouns of classical Sanskrit from Vedic roots, as usnam (werm), ghrtam (clarified butter).3 Further, primary forms alone are employed (in speech) among some people ; secondary forms among others. The verb savati, meaning to go, is used by the Kambojas only. Kambojas (are so called becar.se) they enjoy blankets (kambala), or beautiful things.4 A blanket (kambala) is a desirable object (kamanlya). Its modified form vava is used by the Aryans : ddti, in the sense to cut, is employed by the people of the east, while the people of the north use ddtra (sickle).5 In this manner, one should explain single words.

Verily knowledge approached Brahmana, ' Protect me, I am thy treasure. Do not expound me to the scornful, nor to the unstraightforward, nor to one who has no self-control ; thus shall I grow powerful.'2

One should honour him as a father and mother, and should never bear enmity towards him who pierces ears with truth, without causing pain, and besto\\ ing ambrosia.3

Just as religious students, who, having received instruction, do not- honour their teachers with word, thought, and deed, are not to be fed by the 'teacher, similarly that knowledge does not feed them.

In order to protect thy treasure, O Brahman ! expound me to him alone whom thou knowest to be pure, diligent, intelligent, observing the rules of a celibate life, and who never bears enmity towards thee.4

tievadhi means treasure.*

Now, therefore, we shall proceed in order. The word gauh is a synonym of ' earth ', (so called) because it goes very far, or because people go over it (Vgam). Or it may be derived from (the root) go, with the suffix an (go, + au = gau). Moreover, it is a synonym of ' an animal ', from

the same root also. Further, in the latter meaning, there are Vedic passages where primary forms (of gauh) are used in a derivative sense : ' Mix soma with milk ',ci. e. (gauh is used in the sense) of milk. Matsarah means soma; it is derived from (the root) mand meaning to satisfy. Matsarah is a synonym of greed also: it makes man mad a^fter wealth. Payas (milk) is derived from (the root) pa (to drink), or fr6m pydy (to swell). Kslmm (milk) is derived from (the root) ksar (to flow), orjit is derived from ghas (to consume) with the suffix Ira, like uxlra (root of

Amsuh (soma is so calledbecause) no sooner than it goes in, it is agreeable, or it is agreeable for life. Carma (skin) is derived from (the root) car (to move) or (it is so calledbecause) it is cut off (from the body). Moreover (gauh) means skin andphlegm :* Thou art girded round with skin and phlegm, be strong' ; 2 this (is said) in praise of a chariot. s Moreover, it means tendon andphlegm :' Girt with tendon and phlegm, it flies when discharged' ; 3 thisis in praise of an arrow.

Sautanu, the younger brother, caused himself to be installed as king. Dovapi retired to practise austerities. From that time the god did not rain for twelve years in the kingdom of 6antanu. The Brahmanas said to him, ' Thou hast committed (an act of) unrighteousness. Because thou hast caused thyself to be installed as king, having put thy elder brother aside, therefore the god does not rain in thy kingdom/ Then he, i.e. Santanu. sought to invest Devapi with sovereignty.

In the measurement of gods they stood first; from their division, waters flowed down. The three working in succession warm the earth ; the two carry the fertilizing moisture.4

In the creation of gods they, i.e. groups of atmospheric gods, stood first.5 First is a synonym of ' chief': it is foremost. [Krntatram G means atmosphere, i. e. where the clouds are cut into pieces.] By cutting clouds into pieces water 7 is produced. The three working in succession warm the earth, i. e. cloud, wind, and sun cause the herbs to become ripe with heat, cold, and rain. Working in succession, i.e. with their respective functions, they sow the worlds one after, another. This other (meaning of) anupa, i. e. a bank of a river, is derived from the same (root) also : it is sown with water. Or else it may (really) be anvdp, just like prdc ; from that form (anvdp) anupa may be derived as prdclna (from prdc).

CHAPTER IV

HOMONYMS

SYNONYMS i have been explained. Now therefore we shall take homonyms 2 in their respective order and (such) Vedic words whose gram matical forms are obscure. They call this (i.e. the list of homonyms) aika padikam,3 (i.e. composed of single words).

Jahd means' I have killed '.

(Here ends the first section.)
### 

men, what friend has said, Unprovoked I have killed my friend ? who flies from us 1 *

The word marya is a synonym of man, or it may be a synonym of boundary. [Boundary, it is settled by men.] Boundary is the (line of) division between two bounded places. Methati means to provoke. What innocent man have I ever killed ?5 Who runs away from us because he is afraid of us ?

Nidha, means ' a net ', (so called) because it is laid (on the ground). Pasyd means a collection of snares. Pdsah (snare) is derived from (the root) pas (to fasten), on account of being fastened.

(Here ends the second section.)
### 

Imploring seers, fond of sacrifices, approached Indra like birds of beauti ful wings. Uncover the encompassed, fill our vision, release us as if we were bound by a net.6

Vayah is the plural of vi (bird). [Of beautiful wings, i.e.] the beauti fully falling rays of the sun approached Indra imploring. Uncover our encompassed vision.7 Caksuh (eye) is derived from (the root) khyd (to know), or caks (to see). Fill, i.e. enlarge or give. Kelease us who are bound with snares as it were.

Ry the region of ribs, hips, and arms.8

Roth, op. cit., p. 88. itself, while in the list of synonyms the 8 Frag, of VS. 21. 43 ; TB. iii. 6. 11. 1. words are arranged in groups. However, Durga quotes and explains the stanza in full.4. 4] MEHANA 57      

The region of the ribs, i.e. a part (of the body) consisting of joints.1 Parsuh (joint) is derived from (the.root) spry (to touch) : it touches the backpart. Prstkam (back) is derived from (the root) sprit (to touch) : it is touchedby limbs (of the body). A limb is (so called) from being marked, or from beingbent.2 &ronik (hip) is derived from (the root) won, meaning to go forward,i.e. a hip appears to go forward when a person walks. Sitdma means fore- foot (doe). Dos (fore-foot) is derived from (the root) dru (to run).' tiitdmameans uterus,' says akapuni,' it is open.'' It means liver on account of its dark-red colour,' says Taitiki. tiydmam (dark-red) is derived from (the root) tyai (to cause to congeal). Liver is (so called because) it is cut outwith great difficulty.3 ' (tiitdma) means fat, becausait is white (viti) meat(mdmsam) ', says Galava. &iti (white) is derived from (the root) so (to whet). Mdmsam (meat), it is honoured ; 4 it is thoughtr> (delicious) ; orelse, the mind perishes in it. Medas (fat) is derived from (the root) mid (to

grow fat).

(Here etuis the third section.)

O Indra, wielder of the thunderbolt, give us whatever excellent treasure there is. With both hands bring that wealth to us, O treasure-knower.' . Whatever [excellent], glorious, and abundant wealth there is, O Indra ; or that which I do not here possess, (i. e. taking me-ha-nd)7 as consisting of three words, that wealth should be given to us, O wielder of the thunderbolt. Adrih (thunderbolt) is (so called because) with it he splits (mountains), or it may be derived from (the root) ad (to eat).

It is well known: they are eaters of soma.8 The word rddhas is a synonym of wealth : with it, they conciliate. Bring that wealth to us, O Lord to whom treasures are known, with both thy hands. Let boththy hands be full.

Damunds? one who is inclined towards kindness, or one who is inclined to charity, or one who is inclined to self-control. Or else the word dwnia is a synonym of home ; (damund*, therefore) may mean,' one who is devotedto home '. Manas (mind) is derived from (the root) mail (to think). (Here ends the fourth section.)

Bricks, i. e. bricks of the well, torment me on every side, like rival wives. As mice devour the greasy threads.

earth, of this (state) of mine.] Realize, O heaven and earth, this (state) of mine. This hymn was revealed to Trita fallen into a well.6 With refer- ence to this, there is an invocation, accompanied with a legend, a stanza, and a gatha.1 Trita, was one most eminent in wisdom. Or else the word

may have been intended as a synonym of number, i. e. ekatah, dvitah, tritah, thus the three were produced.8

Indra, accompanied by the Maruts, i. e. having the Maruts as his com panions. Bull, i. e. one who brings down rain. For battle, for a delightful battle. Drink soma for rapture, i.e. for a maddening victory, after food, i. e. after meals.6 Pour down the flood of mead into thy belly. Madhumeans soma, is derived from (the root) mad (to exhilarate), and is comparedwith soma (on account of the analogy of exhilaration). This other (meaningof) madhu (wine) is derived from the same (root) also. Thou art the king of soma-draughts (now, as thou wert) in the former days.

She has appeared lil:e the breast, i. e. light that is exalted, of the pure one. The pure one is the sun, (so called) from purifying. This other (meaning of) vaksas (breast) is derived from the same (root) also : it is exalted in the body. A bird, too, is called the pure one, fron. the same purifying: it roams over waters. Waters, too, are called tbe pure one, from the same purifying. Nodhas (singer) means a seer: he composes a new hymn. As he makes his desires apparent in his songs of praise, so dawn manifests her beauteous forms. Adma-sad 9 (mother) adma means food i.e. one who sits at a meal, or one who obtains food.

May we obtain that illimitable gift of thine. The sun is called aku para also, i. e. unlimited, because it is immeasurable. The ocean, too, is called akupdra, i. e. unlimited, because it is boundless. A tortoise is also called a-kupa-ara, because it does not move in a well.3 Kaccliiipa (tor toise) is (so called because) it protects (pdti) its mouth (kaccham),* or it protects itself by means of its shell (kacchena), or it drinks (Vpa) by the mouth. Kaccha (mouth or shell of a tortoise) = kha-ccha, i. e. something which covers (chddayatl) space (kham).

The womb is within the two widespread world halves ; the father here bestowed a life-germ on the daughter.8 Heaven is my father, protector, benefactor, progenitor; here is my uterine relative ; the great earth is my mother. Relative is (so called) from being connected together. Uterine is (so called) from being fastened together. It is said : children are born fastened to the umbilicus.9 Hence the near relatives are called as having a common umbilicus, or a common tie. A near relative is (so called) from being well known. The womb is within the two widespread world-halves. Widespread, i. e. spread very wide, or spread very high. There the father bestows the life-germ on the daughter, i. e. the rain-cloud on the earth.

Being prosperous, thou hast sacrificed; being prosperous, thou hast toiled.6

In a state of prosperity, thou hast sacrificed ; in a state of prosperity, thou hast exerted thyself.

The words asydh and asya have the acute accent when referring to a primary, and grave when referring to a secondary, object. The more emphatic meaning has the acute accent, the less, the grave.

For the obtainment of this, be near us.

Gracious, without being angry. Rarivdn ^bounteous) is a reduplicated form of (the root) rd (to give). The seer addresses Pusan as goat-teamed. Goat-teamed, goats are his coursers. Now the grave accent :

Let her husband, who has a long life, live for hundred autumns.8 May her husband, who has a long life, live for hundred autumns. Autumn is (so called because) the herbs become ripe during this period, or the rivers are in flood.

Seven yoke the one-wheeled car. One horse having seven names draws it. Three-navelled is the wheel, imperishable and irresistible, on which all these worlds rest.4

Seven yoke the one-wheeled car, i. e. the car which moves on a single wheel. Cakram (wheel) is derived from (the root) cak (to repel), or car (to move), or kram (to go). One horse having seven names draws it, i. e. the sun : seven rays draw up the juices for him, or the seven seers praise him. The other word nama (name) is derived from the same (root, nam) also ;

(so called) from being drawn up. The second hemistich chiefly describes the year: the three-navelled wheel, i.e. the year with its three seasons, summer, rainy season, and winter. Year is (so called because) people live together by them. Summer, juices are swallowed during this period. Rainy season, during this time it rains. Winter, full of snow, Again,

himam 5 (snow) is derived from (the root) han (to injure), or from hi (to hasten). Imperishable, having the characteristic of non-decay. Irre sistible, not dependent on anything else. The seer praises the year, on which all created beings rest together, with all measures. When the five-spoked wheel began to roll.6

This is with reference to the five seasons. There is the Brahmana passage : There are five seasons in the year,7 taking the winter and the dewy season together:

Six are said to have been inserted.8

This is with reference to the six seasons, which are inserted in the navel as spokes. Again, sat (six) is derived from (the root) sah (to bear).

At one single draught Indra drank thirty lakes full of soma.2 At one draught alone Indra drank them together, i. e. along with one another ; this is the meaning. (Lakes) full of soma, i. e. dear to his heart, or full to the brim, or consecrated to Indra. Or else Indra is a lover of soma, or he drinks till his desire, his appetite, is completely satisfied.3 With reference to this, the interpretation of the ritualists is the following : There are thirty libation-vessels consecrated to one deity at the meridional pressing of the soma-juice. These (libation-vessels) they drink at a single draught. They are here called lakes. ' There are thirty days and nights in the second, and thirty in the first half of a month/ say the etymologists. Then the rays drink those same lunar waters which fall on certain days in the second fortnight.4 There is also a Vedic quotation :

The imperishable one whom the imperishable drink.6

They fill him again in the first fortnight. There is also a Vedic quota tion:

As the gods cause the moon to grow.

Adhriguh (lit. irresistible) means a stanza, (so called) from being at the head of a cow (i. e. = adhi-guh). Or else it is intended to refer to an injunc tion, for there is a repetition of words : Toil, O irresistible one, toil well, toil, O irresistible one.7 Fire also is called irresistible.

(The drops) flow for thee, O irresistible and mighty one.8

i. e. One whose motion is unrestrained and who is active. Indra is called irresistible also :

(I send) a gift to the irresistible Indra.9

This too is a Vedic quotation.

With infused energy, rushing to the attack, shaker, impetuous, great hero and foaming, soma surpasses all plants and trees. All the counter- measures did not deceive Indra.2

One whose anger is roused, and who rushes to attack, [i. e. who is quick to attack, or who attacks while moving,] i.e. soma, or Indra. Dhunih (shaker) is derived from (the root) dhu (to shake). The word simi is a synonym of action, or it may be derived from (the root) am (to exert oneself), or from vak (to be able). The foaming soma : that which remains as residue after soma is strained is called ijisam, i. e. something which is thrown away, hence soma is called r/m, i. e. containing the residue. Further, this is used as an epithet of Indra also : rjisi, the wielder of thunderbolt.3 That portion (i. e. the residue) and the grains belong to his (i. e. Indra's) steeds.4 Grains are (so called because) they are parched in a kiln, or dried on a board.

Let thy steeds devour grain and sniff at the residue.5

This too is a Vedic quotation. (Babdhdm)6 is formed by reduplicating the first syllable and removing the penultimate of (the root) bhas, which means to devour. Soma surpasses all plants and trees. All the counter- measures do not deceive Indra ; i. e. the counter-measures which they adopt against him are of no avail before Indra : they perish before they reach him, i. e. without reaching him at all. Some are of opinion that the stanza is primarily addressed to Indra, while the reference to soma is of secondary character. Others hold that it is primarily addressed to both.

Urva&i l is (the name of) a naiad, (so called because) she pervades wide regions (urn + A/as ' to pervade '), or she pervades by means of thighs2 (uru + \/ 'to pervade'), or her desire is great (urn+ */va& 'to desire '). Apeardh (a naiad) is one who moves on water. Or else the word apsas is a synonym of beauty ; it is derived from the negative of (ftie root) paa (to devour) : it is not to be devoured, but to be gazed at, or to be made perva sive.3 ' It is for clear perception,' says Sakapuni. In ' Whatever forbidden food ', 4 (apsas signifies) something which is not to be eaten. In ' Pervading indeed ',5 (the word signifies) pervasive. (Apsarah) is (therefore) one whopossesses that (apsas), i. e. a beautiful person : the beauty is either acquired by her or given to her.6 On seeing her, the seminal fluid of Mitra and Varuna fell down.7 It is to this that the following stanza refers. (Here ends the thirteenth section.)

All the gods sup- ported thee in the atmosphere.10 Puskaram means atmosphere : it nourishes (posati) created beings. Water is called puskuram, because it is a means of worship ('puja-karam), or to be worshipped (VpHj). This other (meaning of) puslcaram (lotus) is derived from the same root also : it is a means of decorating the body (vapus-karam). Pusyam (flower) is derived from (the root) pus (to blossom).

Vayunam is derived from (the root) vi (to string) : it signifies desire or

intelligence.

I have heard that you are more liberal indeed than a would-be son-in law,4i. e. one whose son-in-lawship is not quite complete.5 It is well known that the people in the south apply the term vijdmdtd to the husband of a purchased maiden. By this is meant a bridegroom, whose relationship is not quite complete as it were. Jdmdtd (son-in-law) is (so called because) he is the progenitor of ja, which means offspring. Nay even more than a brother-in law, i. e. more liberal than a brother-in-law.6 They, who are well versed in primary causes, remark that a brother-in-law is (so called because) he comes very near on account of his relationship. Or else he is (so called because) he sows parched grain7 from a winnowing basket. Ldjdh (parched grainy is derived from (the root) Idj (to parch).

Fair (is so called because) it is to be won. Destroyer (is so called) from destroying. But who is the god who has gaps in his teeth ? According to some, it is an epithet of Bhaga who comes before it. According to others, this god is Pusa, because he has no teeth.9 Pusa is without teeth, says a Brahmana passage. O Indra, (make) the tribes liberal and sweet in speech.10 O Indra, make us men charitable and soft in speech.11 This noxious creature thinks me to be without a hero. 12

[^7]:.2] NATURE OF STANZAS US

## 
### 

CHAPTER VII

Now, therefore, (we shall explain) the section (of the Nighantu)relating to deities. The section, which enumerates appellations ofdeities, to whom panegyrics are primarily addressed, is called daivatam,i. e. relating to deities. The following is the detailed examination of thesame. A particular stanza is said to belong to a deity, to whom a seeraddresses his panegyrics1 with a particular desire, and from whom hewishes to obtain his object.2 The stanzas, to which reference has just beenmade,8 are of three kinds : (1) indirectly addressed, (2) directly addressed,(3) and self-invocations. Of these, the indirectly addressed stanzas arecomposed (lit. joined) in all the cases of nouns but the verb of the third

person (only).

(Here ends the first section.)
### 

Irxlra rules heaven, Indra the earth.*

The chanters (praise) very much Indra alone.6

These Trtsns being active with Indra.

Chant the sama-stanzas for the sake of Indra.7

Without Indra, no place whatsoever is pure.1

I will indeed proclaim the heroic exploits of Indra.9

Our desires rest on Indra.10 And so on.

Now the directly addressed stanzas are compositions in the secondperson and are joined with the word ' thou ' as the pronoun. Thou, O Indra, (art born) from strength.11 O Indra, slay our enemies.12 And so on.

Moreover, the praises are directly, while the objects of praise areindirectly, addressed.

Do not praise any other.13

Approach, Ku&kas, be careful.1 Now self-invocations are compositions in the first person and are joined with the word ' I' as the pronoun, e. g. the hymn of Indra Vaikuntha ; 2 the hymn of Lava ; 3 or the hymn of Vak,4 daughter of Ambhrna, and so on.

(Here ends the second section.)
### 

Indirectly addressed and directly addressed stanzas are by far the most numerous. Self-invocations are few and far between. Moreover, (in some stanzas) there is only praise (of the deity) without any benediction (being invoked), as in the hymn : I will indeed proclaim the heroic exploits jf Indra.5 Further, (in some stanzas) there is only benediction without any praise (being offered), as: May I see well with my eyes, may I be radiant in my face, may I hear well with my ears.6 This is mostly found in the Yajurveda (tidhvaryave) and sacrificial formulae.7 Further, (in some stanzas) there are asseverations and imprecations :

May I die to-day, if I be a juggling demon.8 Now may he be deprived of ten heroes.9

Further, (in some stanzas) there is an intention of describing a particular state:

Then was no death, nor indeed immortality.10

In the beginning (of creation) there was darkness, hidden in darkness.11 Further, (in some stanzas) there is apprehension arising from a particular state:

The benevolent god may fly forth to-day and never return.12 I do not know whether I am this or (that).13 And so on. Further, (in some stanzas) there are censure and praise : He alone is guilty who eats alone.14

This dwelling-place of a liberal person is (beautiful) like a lotus-bed.15 Similarly, there is censure of gambling and praise of agriculture in the dice-hymn.16 In this manner and with various intentions, seers have visions of their poetic compositions (mantras).11,

[^7]:. 5] DEITY 115

With reference to this, the following is the ascertainment of the deity of those stanzas whose deity is not specified. Such stanzas belong to the same deity to whom tjiat particular sacrifice, or a part of the sacrifice, is offered. Now, elsewhere than the sacrifice, they belong to Prajapati accord ing to the ritualists ; and to Nara^amsa according to the etymologists.1

Or else the deity may be an optional one, or even a group of deities.2 It is, indeed, a very prevalent practice, (in everyday life) in the world, (to dedicate things in common) including what is sacred to gods, to guests, and to the manes.3 As to the view that a stanza belongs to the deity to whomthe sacrifice is offered, (it may be objected) that non-deities are also praised like deities, e. g. the objects beginning with horse and ending with herbs,4 together with the eight pairs.1. But he (the student) should not think that matters relating to gods are adventitious as it were. This is to be clearly seen (by the following) : On account of the supereminence of the deity, a single soul is praised in various ways. Other gods are the individual limbs of a single soul.6 Or else, as people say, seers praise objects according to the multiplicities of their original nature, as well as from its universality. They are produced from each other.7 They are the original forms of each other.8 They are produced from (action (Ax/rma)),9 they are produced from the soul. Soul is even their chariot, their horse, their weapon, their arrows ; soul is indeed the all-in-all of gods.10

(Here entls the fourth section.)

[^1]: There are three deities only,' nsay the etymologists : (1) Agni, whose sphere is earth ; (2) Vayu or Indra, whose sphere is atmosphere ; (3) the sun, whose sphere is heaven.12 Of these, each receives many appellations on account of his supereminence, or the diversity of his function, just as u priest, although he is one, is called the sacrificer (hotr), the director of the sacrifice (adhvaryu), the possessor of the sacred lore (brahma), and the chanter (udgatr). Or else they may be distinct, for their panegyrics as

well as their appellations are distinct.1 As to the view that (one receives many appellations) on account of the diversity of functions, (it may be remarked) that many men also can do the actions, having divided them among thenwelves. With regard to it, the community of jurisdiction and enjoyment ihould be noted, as for instance, the community of men and gods with regard to earth. Community of enjoyment is seen in the following, i. e. the enjoyment of earth by the cloud, together with air and the sun, and of the other world together with Agni. There everything is like the kingdom of man also.

(Here ends the fifth section.)
### 

Now (we shall discuss) the appearance of the gods. Some say that they are anthropomorphic, for their panegyrics as well as their appellations are like those of sentient beings. Moreover they are praised with reference to anthropomorphic limbs :

Indra, the two arms of the mighty one are noble.-

That (heaven and earth), which thou hast seized, is thy fist, lord of wealth.3

Moreover (they are praised) as associated with anthropomorphic objects : O Indra, come with thy team of two bay steeds.4 A beautiful wife and delightful things are in thy house.5 Moreover (they are praised) with regard to anthropomorphic actions : Indra, eat and drink the (soma) placed before (thee).6

Hear our call, O God that hast listening ears.7

(Here ends the sixth section.)
### 

Others say that they are not anthropomorphic, because whatever is seen of them is unanthropomorphic, as for instance, fire, nir, the sun, earth, the moon, &c. As to the view that their panegyrics are like those of sentient beings, (we reply) that inanimate objects, beginning from dice and ending with herbs,8 are likewise praised. As to the view that they are praised with reference to anthropomorphic limbs, (we reply) that this (treatment) is accorded to inanimate objects also :

They shout with their green mouths.9 This is a panegyric of stones. As to the view that (they are praised) as associated with anthropo

objects) :

This is a panegyric of a river. As to the view that (they are praised) with regard to anthropomorphic actions, (we reply) that it is exactly the same (in the case of inanimate objects) :

Even before the sacriticer, they taste the delicious oblations.2 This too is a panegyric of stones. Or else they may be both anthropomorphic and unanthropomorphic. Or else (the unanthropomorphic appearance) of the gods, who are really anthropomorphic,15 is their counterself in the form of action. (Karma) as sacrifice is that of a sacrificer. This is the well-con- sidered opinion of those who are well versed in legendary lore. (Here eiuts tie, seventh section.)

It has been said before that there are three deities only. Now we shall explain their shares and companions. Now the following are the shares of Agni : this world, the morning libation, spring, the Gdyinrl metre, the triple hymn, the ratlantaram chant, and the group of gods who are enumerated in the first place.4

Ayitayl (wife of Agni), Prill vl (earth), and Hcl (praise) are the women. Now its function is to carry oblations and to invoke the gods. And all that which relates to vision is the function of Agni also. Now the gods with whom Agni is jointly praised are (1) Indra. (2) Soma, (3) Vnruna, (4) Parjanya, and (5) the Rtavas. There is a joint oblation offered to, but no joint panegyric addressed to, Agni and Visnu in the ten books (of the

R<jveda)J' Moreover there is a joint oblation offered to, but no joint panegyric addressed to. Agni and Pusan. With regard to this, the following stanza is cited (in order to show their) separate praise.

Now the following are the shares of Indra : the atmosphere, the midday libation, the summer, the trfytubh metre, the fifteenfold hymn, the great chant,1 and the gods who are enumerated in the middle place as well as the women.- Now his function is to release the waters and to slay Vrtra. And all action that relates to strength is Indra's function also. 5 Now the gods with whom Indra is jointly praised are Agni, Soma, Varuna, Pusan, Brhaspati, Brahmanaspati, Parvata, Kutsa, Visnu, Vayu. Moreover, Mitra is jointly praised with Varuna ; Soma with Pusan and Rudra ; Pusan with Vayu ; and Parjanya with Vata.

Now the following are the shares of Aditya : that world (i. e. heaven), the third libation, the rainy season, the jagaM metre, the seventeenfold hymn, the Vairu'pa chant, and the gods enumerated in the highest place as well as the women.4 Now his function is to draw out and hold the juices with his rays. All that relates to greatness5 is Aditya's function also. He is jointly praised with Candramas, Vayu, and Samvatsara. One should frame the remaining portions of seasons, metres, hymns, &c. in accordance with the distribution of the places (already mentioned). Autumn, the anustiM metre, the twenty fold hymn, the Vairaja chant are terrestrial. Winter, the pdnkti metre, the twenty-sevenfold hymn, the &dkvara 7 chant are atmospheric. The dewy season, the aticcJtandas metres, the thirty-threefold hymn, the Raivata chant are celestial.8

Stanzas are (so called) from thinking, metres from covering, [hymn from praising]. Yajus is derived from (the root) yaj (to sacrifice). Samu, is (so called because) it is measured out by the stanza, or it may be derived from (the root) as (to throw).' He thought it equal to the stanza,' say they who are well versed in Vedic metres.

Gdyatrll is derived from (the root) gai, meaning to praise, or from gam with tri by metathesis, i. e. three-coursed.

There is a Brahmana passage :' It fell out of (Brahma's) mouth while he was singing'. Usnih is (so called because) it has stepped out, or it may be derived from (the root) sulk, meaning to shine. Or comparatively speaking, (it is so called) as if furnished with a head-dress. Ustilsa (head

dress) is derived from (the root) snui (to wrap round). Kakubh is (so called because) it has an elevation. Kakubh and kubja (crooked) are derived from (the root) kuj (to be crooked) or ul>j (to press down). Amistiibh is (so called) from praising after. There is a Brahmana passage : It follows the Gdyatri, which consists of three verses only, (with its fourth verse of praise). BrJtAttl - is (so called) from its great growth.

PaiJdi* is a stanza of five verses. The second member of the word Tri$t\ibh4 is derived from (the root) stubh (to praise). But what does the tri mean ? (It means swiftest), i. e. it is the swiftest metre. Or (it is so called because) it praises the threefold thunderbolt. It is known : that it praised thrice, that is the characteristic of the Tristubh.5

With these words, these deities are dealt with. Those to whom the hymns are addressed, oblations are offered, and stanzas are addressed are by far the most numerous. Some are incidentally mentioned.3 Moreover, one offers oblations to gods, having announced (lit. joined together) them

with their characteristic appellations, as to Indra, the destroyer of Vrtra, [to Indra, who excels Vrtra], to Indra, the deliverer from distress, and so on. Some make a list of these also, but they are too numerous to be collected together in a list. I enlist that appellation only which has

become a conventional epithet and with reference to which chief praise is addressed (to the deity). Moreover, a seer praises deities with regard to their activities, as (Indra), the Vrtra-slayer, or the city-destroyer, and so on. Some make a list of these also, but they are too numerous to be collected together in a list. These (epithets) are mere indications of (a particular aspect of the proper) appellations, just as' give food to a Br&hmana who is hungry, or unguents to one who has taken a bath, or water to one who is thirsty '. 4 (Here ends the thirteenth section,.)

Now, therefore, we shall take up the deities in their respective order. We shall first explain Agni,5 whose sphere is the earth. From what root is Agni derived ? He is the foremost leader,6 he is led foremost in sacrifices, he makes everything, to which it inclines, a part of himself. ' He is a drying agent ', says Sthaulas^hlvi,' it does not make wet, it does not moisten.' 'It is derived from three verbs', says Sakapuni, 'from

going, from shining or burning, and from leading.' He, indeed, takes the letter a from the root i (to go), the letter ft from the root atij (to shine), or dah (to burn), with the root ni (to lead) as the last member. The follow- ing stanza is addressed to him.

Of the sacrifice ; the sacrifice!- and the best bestower of gifts.1 I praise Agni, I beseech Agni. The root -Id means to solicit, or to worship. Purohita (placed foremost) and yajua (sacrifice) have been ex plained. Dew (god) is (so called) from making gifts (Vda) or from being brilliant (Vdip), from being radiant (*/dyut), or because his sphere is heaven. He who is called god (deva) is also called deity (devata). Sacrifice!*, invoker. (Hotd) (sacrificer) is derived from (the root) ku (to sacrifice), says Aurnav&bnft. ' The best bestower of gifts ', the most liberal giver of delightful riches. The following additional stanza is addressed to him also.

Agni should be solicited by seers, old as well as new ; he shall bring the gods here.2

May Agni, who should be solicited, [should be worshipped], by older seers as well as by us, who are the younger ones, bring the gods to this place. He (the student) should not think that Agni refers to this (terres trial fire) only. The two highef luminaries (lightning and the sun) are called Agni also. With reference to this (the following stanza refers to) the Agni of the middle region.

Enjoying them, the god who has all created beings as his property is gratified. The root her means to desire to obtain, i. e. he desires to obtain them again and again.

The wise speak cf this very Agni, [and] the great self, in various ways, as Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni, and the divine Garutman. Divine, born in heaven. Garutman is (so called because) he is praised, or whose soul is mighty, or whose soul is great. He to whom the hymn is addressed and the oblation is offered, is this very (terrestrial) Agni. These two higher luminaries receive (praise and oblations) under this appellation incidentally only.5

He knows all created beings, or he is known to all created beings, or else he pervades every created being, or he has all created beings as his property or wealth, or he has all created beings as his knowledge, i. e. dis- cernment.

worthy of being worshipped. For the pressing and straining of the immortal king, i.e. the soma, he shall consume, i.e. he will burn with determination, or reduce the property of the niggard to ashes, for the sake

of sacrifice. The meaning is that he will cause soma to be offered. He takes us, i. e. the assembly, across all obstacles, all difficult places. Agni carries us across troubles like a river, a very deep and broad stream, by

a boat, i. e. he helps us to overcome difficulties as if he were to take us across a river by means of a boat. The following additional stanza is addressed to him also.)* Do ye impel Jatavedas, the strong horse, to sit on this our grass.2

With your actions impel Jatavedas, who pervades everywhere. Or else it may be a simile, i. e. Jatavedas, who is like a horse, may he sit on this our grass. In the ten books (of the Ryvedv) there is but a single hymn, containing three stanzas in the Gayatri metre, addressed to Jatavedas. But whatever is addressed to Agni, is associated with Jatavedas too./ He(the student) should not think that this refers to (terrestrial) Agni alone ; even these two upper lights are called Jatavedas also.

With reference to this, (the following stanza refers to) the Agni of the middle region.

Let them procure like maidens of the same mind.3

This we have already explained.4 Now (the following stanza refers to) the sun.

They uplift him, Jatavedas.5 We shall explain this later on.6 He, to whom the hymn is addressed and the oblation is offered, is this very (terrestrial) Agni Jatavedas. These two upper luminaries receive (praise and oblations) under this appellation incidentally only.7

Born from this world, he surveys the entire universe. VaisVanara stretches together with the sun. May we be in the benevolent will of Vaisvanara, i. e. of him who is the king and the place of refuge of all created beings. But who is Vaisvanara ? The preceptors say,' This is the atmospheric fire, for the seer praises him with regard to the phenomenon of rain '.

### 

I will proclaim the greatness of the bull. Supplicating men attend upon him who is the slayer of Vrtra. The VaiSvanara Agni killed the demon, shook the waters, and shattered 6ambara.2

I will speak forth the greatness, i.e. the pre-eminence of the bull, i. e. the sprinkler of the waters. Supplicating men, i. e. whose request is to be granted, and who are desirous of rain, attend upon, i. e. serve him, who is the slayer of Vrtra, i. e. the cloud. Dasyu (demon) is derived from (the root) das, meaning to lay waste : in him the juices are wasted, or he causes works to be laid waste.3 The VaiSvanara Agni slew him, shook the waters, and shattered 6ambara, i. e. the cloud.

[^1]: Now (the reference is) to that sun,' say the older ritualists. The tradition handed down in the sacred texts is that the increase of libations is in accordance with the ascending order of these worlds. After the ascension, the series of descending is designed. The sacrifice!* accomplishes this series of descending with the VaisVanara hymn,4 recited on (the occasion of) the invocation addressed to Agni and the Maruts. But he should not lay too much emphasis on the hymn, for it is addressed to Agni. From thence he comes to Rudra and the Maruts, the deities whose sphere is the atmosphere ; from thence to Agni, whose sphere is this very world, and it is precisely on this spot that he recites the hymn.5

Moreover, the oblation assigned to VaisVanara is distributed in twelve potsherds,6 for his function is twelvefold. Moreover, there is a Brahmana

passage: That Aditya verily is Agni Vaisvanara.1 Further, the invoca tions in the liturgy are addressed to VaisVanara, the sun, as : ' Whoillumines heaven and earth'.2

He indeed illuminates both heaven and earth. Further, the chdiulomikahymn 3 is addressed to VaisVanara, the sun : He shone present in heaven.

He, indeed, shone present in heaven. Further, the havispantlya*(i. e. libation to be drunk) hymn is addressed to VaisVanara, the sun. 4 This very (i. e. terrestrial) fire is VaisVanara,' says 6akapuni.5 Thesetwo upper lights are called VaisVanara also. This (terrestrial) tire is calledVaigvanara, because it is engendered from them (i.e. the upper lights). But how is it engendered from them ? Where the lightning fire strikesa place of shelter,6 it retains the characteristics of the atmospheric fire, i. e. flashing in waters and becoming extinguished in solid bodies, as long as(that object) is not seized upon. But as soon as it is seized upon, this very(terrestrial) fire is produced, which becomes extinguished in water, andblazes in solid bodies.

Now (the following is the process of its production) from the sun.The sun having first revolved towards the northern hemisphere, a personholds a polished (piece of) white copper, or crystal, focusing the sun-raysin a place where there is some dry cow-dung, without touching it : it blazesforth, and this very (terrestrial) fire is produced.7 Moreover, the seer hassaid:

Vais*vanara stretches with the sun.8

But the sun itself cannot stretch together with his own self. Apar ticular thing stretches together with something different only. Onekindles this fire from this world, the rays of that one become manifest fromthe other world. Having seen the conjunction of their light with theflames of this terrestrial fire, the seer made (the above-mentioned) remark.Now (had VaisVauara been the sun), there would have occurred expres sions relating to VaisVanara in those same hymns and shares which areassigned to celestial deities, i.e. Savitr, [Surya], Pusan, Visnu, and [theVisVedevas.] And they would have praised him by (attributing to him)the functions of the sun, as thou risest, tliou settest, thou revolvest, &c.It is only in the hymns addressed to Agni that there are found expressions

As to (the view) that the seer praises him (by attributing) the pheno- menon of rain, (we reply) that it is possible with regard to this (terrestrial) fire also.

Uniform with days, this water goes up and falls down again. Clouds bring new life to earth, fires animate heaven.1

This stanza is explained by the mere reading of it.

The bay steeds having beautiful wings clad in waters fly up their dark course to heaven. They turned round from the seat of waters, and lo ! the earth is made wet with clarified butter.2

The dark egression, i.e. the njght of the sun. Bay steeds having beautiful wings are the draught-animals, i. e. the rays of the sun.3 When from heaven, from the common dwelling-place of waters, i. e. the sun, they turn down towards the earth, the latter is made wet with clarified butter, i.e. water. The word yhrta is a synonym of water; it is derived from (the root) ghr, meaning to besprinkle. Moreover, there is a Brahmana passage: Agni verily sends forth rain from this world. Having become [indeed] the space-coverer (i.e. cloud) in the atmosphere, it. rains; the Maruts conduct the emitted rain. When, indeed, the sun turns round fire with his rays, then it rains.4 As to (the view) that after ascension the series of descending is designed, (we reply) that this takes place by the injunction of the sacred texts. As to (the view) that the oblation assigned to Vaisvanara is distributed in twelve potsherds, (we reply) that the num ber of potsherds has no (reference to) the explanation (of the function), for the oblation 5 assigned to the sun is distributed in one, as well as in five potsherds. As to the Brahmank quotation, (we reply) that the Brahmanas, indeed, speak of many divisions, as : the earth is Vaisvanara, the year is Vaisvanara, Brahmana is VaiSvanara,6 and so on.

As to (the view) that invocations in the liturgy are addressed to VaisVanara, the sun, (we reply) that the liturgy is addressed to this very (terrestrial) fire.' Who shone for the tribes of men.' 7 As to (the view) that

Whom the messenger of the gods brought from the shining one, the sun who drives away darkness, whoimpels all things and who is very far.

The gods made that Agrii, whom they generated in heaven and earth with a hymn and who fills both heaven and earth, with [powers], i.e. actions, for threefold existence. ' For the terrestrial, atmospheric, and celestial (existence)/ says &akapuni. There is a Brahmana passage: Its third part, which is in heaven, is the sun.3 With these words, the seer praises him with reference to fire. Now, in the following stanza, the seer praises him with reference to the sun.

How is the word mithuiut 6 (couple) derived ? It is derived from (the root) mi, meaning to depend, with the suffix thu or tha, having the root nl or van as the last member. Depending on each other, they lead each other, or win each other.

Its (meaning), i. e.' human couple ', is derived from the same root also ; or else they win each other, when they are united. Now. in the following stanza, the seer praises him with reference to Agni.

O Matarisvan, as long as the birds of beautiful wings wear directly the illumination of dawn, so long the Brahmana, sitting lower than the sacrifice, and approaching the sacrifice, bears it.1

As long as there is the illumination or the manifestation of dawn. Theparticle of comparison is here used in the sense of * directly ', as* place it .directly here'. (As long as) birds of beautiful wings, which fly in a beautiful manner, i. e. these nights, O MatarisVan, wear the light of the bright colour, so long the Brahmana sacrificer, who approaches the sacrificer and sits lower than this sacrificer, i. e. this Agni, bears it.

But the recitation of the sacrificer is addressed to VaisVanara, who is not Agni : divine Savitr, he chooses thee, i. e. this fire, for the sacri fice, along with thy father, VaisVanara. The seer calls this very fire * Savitr ' (stimulator), and the atmospheric or the celestial fire, who is the progenitor of all,' father '. He to whom the hymn is addressed and the oblation is offered is this same (terrestrial) Agni VaisVanara. These twoupper luminaries receive (praise and oblations) under this appellation

incidentally only.

CHAPTEE VIII

FROM what root is dravinodah (giver of wealth) derived ? Dravinammeans wealth (so called) because people run ( */dru) towards it, or strength (so called) because people run by means of it; dravinodah (therefore) means the giver of wealth or strength.2 The following stanza is addressed to him.

(Here ends the first section.)
### 

Thou art the giver of wealth. In worship, the priests with stones in their hands adore the god in sacrifices.3

It is thou who art the giver of wealth.4 The word dravinasah means

people who sit down (to distribute) wealth, or who prepare (offerings of) wealth. Or else it means a cup of soma :* let him drink from this.' They adore, i. e. implore, praise, increase, or worship the god in sacrifices.

But who is this giver of wealth ?' It is Indra ', says Kraustuki ;' he is the most liberal giver of strength and wealth,1 and all deeds relating to strength belong to him/ The seer also says :

I think he is indeed born of energetic strength.2

Moreover a seer calls Agni a descendant of the giver of wealth, because he is born from him.3

Who generated fire between two stones.4 This too is a Vedic

quotation.

Further, there are expressions relating to the 'giver of wealth' in (stanzas used in) sacrifices and offered to the seasons. 'Indra's drink', again, is the (name) of their vessel. Further, he is praised with reference to the drinking of soma. Further, a seer says : May the giver of wealth

and his descendant drink.5

' This very (i. e. terrestrial) Agni is called " giver of wealth ",' says akapuni. The expressions referring to ' the giver of wealth ' are found in hymns addressed to Agni only.6

Gods supported Agni, giver of wealth.7 This too is a Vedic quotation. As to (the view) that Indra is the most liberal giver of strength and wealth, (we reply) that all gods possess supernatural power. As to (the quotation) ' I think he is indeed born of energetic strength ',8 (we reply) that this very (i. e. terrestrial) tire is produced when churned with energetic strength ;

he is therefore called ' son of strength ',' offspring of strength ',' child of strength ', and so on.9 As to (the view) that a seer calls Agni' a descendant of the giver of wealth ', (we reply) that he is so called as he is generated by the priests, who are here called ' givers of wealth ', because they offer oblations.10

This son of seers is the overlord.11 This too is a Vedic quotation. As to (the view) that ' Indra's drink' is the name of their drinking-cup, (we reply) that it is a mere apportionment,12 as all the cups used in drinking soma are called ' belonging to Vayu '. As to (the view) that he is

With these words, these eleven Apri hymns are dealt with. Of these, the hymns of Vasistha, Atri, Vadhryasva, and Grtsamada are addressed to Narasamsa ; the hymns of Medhatithi, Dirghatamas, and that of invitation (praisas) to both (i. e. Naras*amsa and Tanunapat). The hymns other than

Bestow upon us, O lord of the abode, as a cow her milk, the honeyed wave, distilling honey, i. e. water, well purified like clarified butter. May the lords or protectors of law be gracious to us. The verb mrlay means to protect, or to worship. With reference to this some think that the recurrence of the same expression in the same stanza means tautology, as for instance,' the wave rich in honey ', and ' distilling honey'; others think that the recurrence of the same expression in the same verse (pada) is tautology, as for instance, 'Golden in form, he is golden in

appearance'.4 Another school of thought does not admit tautology, if there is some difference, even if it is very slight, as for instance,' as from water the frogs ', and ' as frogs from water '. 5

Of the soma which the Brahmanas know, none whatsoever, i. e. no one who does not offer sacrifice, can partake. This is with reference

to sacrifice.

Now with reference to the deity. The hemistich, ' Because they grind the herbs together, one thinks that he has drunk the soma ', refers to the soma pressed with the Yajus formula, which is not soma at all. Of the soma which the Brahmanas know, i. e. the moon, none whatsoever, i. e. no

### 

O god, when they drink thee, forth thenceforward thou thrivest again. Wind is the protector of soma ; the month is the maker of years. O god, when they begin to drink thee, forth thenceforward thou again thrivest ; this refers to some particular libations, or to the first and second fortnights of the lunar month. Wind is the protector of soma. The seer calls wind its protector on account of companionship or extracting the juice.4

The month is the maker of years, of annual periods, i. e. the plant soma on account of its (assuming) particular shapes, or the moon. Can-dramas 5 (the moon) is (so called because) it roams about noticing ( Vcay + Vdram) or is bright and measures (candra-md), or its measure is bright.

Having finished the works with utmost quickness, the bearers, or the wise Rbhus, attained immortality although they were mortals. The Rbhus, sons of Sudhanvan, looking like the sun, or wise like the sun. They mixed things together with their works, i. e. actions during the year.

Rbhu, Vibhvau, and Vaja were the three sons of Sudhanvan, a descendant of Arigiras.2 With reference to them there are Vedic passages which mention the first and the last (Rbhu and Vaja) in the plural number, but not the middle one. With regard to this, i. e. the use of plural number

of Rbhu and the praising together of the cup, there are many hymns in the ten books (of the Rgveda). The rays of the sun are called Rbhus also. When you slept in the house of the unconcealable one, because (you were) there, hence, Rbhus, you did not come here to-day.:i

The unconcealable one is the sun, (so called because) he cannot be con cealed. Because you slept in his house ; as long as you remain there, so long you cannot be here.

(Here ends the twenty-second section.}
### 

At the birth and ordinance of Daksa, thou attendest, Aditi, on the two kings Mitra and Varuna. In births of diverse forms, Aryaman of the seven priests and rich in chariots has his path unobstructed.2 O Aditi, thou attendest on two kings, Mitra and Varuna, at the birth and the ordinance, i. e. action, of Daksa. The verb vivasti is used in the sense of attending. Rich in obligations, he attends ujwn (gods).3 Or it is

used in the sense of ' praying for '.* Aryaman, i. e. the sun, having many chariots,5 and whose path is unobstructed, i. e. unimpeded, chastises the enemy.6 Seven priests : seven rays extract juices for him, or seven seers praise him. In births of diverse forms, i. e. activities, sunrises.7

They say that Daksa is a son of Aditi and is praised among the sons of Aditi. But Aditi is the daughter of Daksa.

Daksa was born from Aditi, and Aditi sprang into life from Daksa.8 This (is the text) also.9 How can this be possible ? (We reply) they may have 'had the same origin, or, in accordance with the nature of gods, they may have been born from each other, or they may have derived their characteristics from each other.10 Agni is called Aditi also. The following stanza is addressed to him.

Agas is

derived from (the root) gam, preceded by the preposition a. Enas (sin) is derived from (the root) i (to go). Kil-bwam : destroyer<r?f glory, i. e. averseness to the performance of noble deeds: it destroy^ the reputation of a person.

With what desire has Sarama attained this place ? The road leads far off to distant regions. What is the errand for us ? what was the night ? and how hast thou crossed the waters of the Rasa ?l With what desire has Sarama come here? The road is distant. Jagurih (leading) is derived from the intensive form of the verb gam (to go). (Far off), i. e. winding with curves. What was the errand with regard to us ? what night ? Paritakmya, means night, (so called) because takma surrounds it on both sides. Takma is a synonym of heat, (so called) because it goes away ( Vtak). How hast thou crossed the waters of the Rasa ? Rasa, a river, is derived from (the verb) ras, meaning to make a sound. Or else how (hast thou crossed) those roaring waters ?

According to some they are heaven and earth ; 5 day and night, according to others, Some take them to be the sun and the moon, (while) the historians regard them as two virtuous kings.

From what analogy is this so? From the analogy that at his time it is dark below on earth. Having characteristic black marks on the lower parts, i. e. dark in the lower parts. From what analogy is this so ? Having kindled the sacred fire, one should not approach a lovely dark maiden.
