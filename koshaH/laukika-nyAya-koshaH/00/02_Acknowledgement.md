I gratefully acknowledge the help rendered by the following scholars in preparing this work. I am highly obliged to all of them. I thank Prof. R. Srihari, retired ViceChancellor of Dravidian University, Kuppam (A.P) for permitting me to use his book. I am also thankful to Prof. K.S. Arjunwadkar, a versatile scholar of Maharashtra for allowing me to use his books especially the Bhuvanesalaukikasāhasrī. Dr. Prasad Joshi prepared a consolidated copy of all the Nyayas and my revered friend Prof. Y.S. Kulkarni has gone through the work and has given his valuable suggestions wherever needed. I thank both these scholars for their help. The tedious work of proof-correction was undertaken by Prof. Dr. Kanchan Mande, Head dept. of Sanskrit, S.P. College, Pune. Inspite of her tight schedule she willingly agreed to give a helping hand in preparing a list of all the Nyāyas in Devanagari alphabetical order and thus upholding the motto निर्वाह : प्रतिपन्नवस्तुषु of her institution. I thank her sincerly.

I also thank sincerly Shri Gautambhai-Bharatiya Kala Prakashan, Delhi for undertaking the task of printing and publishing this book. I express my indebtedness to all of them.
