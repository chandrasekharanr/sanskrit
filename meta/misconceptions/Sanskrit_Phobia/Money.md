- Sanskrit is not the optimal language to learn in order to earn more money. So, we should ditch it and teach German, Chinese, etc.. \[[FP](http://www.firstpost.com/india/speak-german-smriti-iranis-hindutva-agenda-dims-prospects-kendriya-vidyalaya-students-1802783.html)\]
  - Earning more money is not the only reason to teach languages to our children. There are very strong humanistic and aesthetic reasons to favor Sanskrit. If we want diversity in the international languages taught to our children, that is welcome - let them compete with English - not Sanskrit.
