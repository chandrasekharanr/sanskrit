- Accusation: You cannot do or teach modern technical subjects (eg. maths, physics, chemistry, biology...) in sanskrit.
- False - You can, and it will be quite precise, meaningful and fun. Example of a brief description of titration and stellar chain reactions - [MT16](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/05/21/svabha%E1%B9%A3aya%E1%B9%83-sastriya-sik%E1%B9%A3a/)([TW16](https://twitter.com/agnimaan/status/769049896922013697)).
- Chinese, Japanese, Israelis and Germans do science in their own languages. Among them, Hebrew is a revived language.
- That said, we can still concede that we can expediently use English for such subjects while retaining sanskrit for the soft sciences.
