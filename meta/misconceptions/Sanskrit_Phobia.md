## Dead language.
- Some limited decline:
    - [Q15](https://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-sanskrit-used-anymore).
- Lay use
    - Despite contrary socio-economic forces, it is vitally alive. For numbers, see[this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21msg/bvparishat/QFqoGrD-KrA/R8NvUSDoWwsJ).
    - Just search Youtube for Sanskrit videos - even omitting ancient hymns, you will find a lot.
    - "Sanskrit villages" -
        - mattUru [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0I8h5oCbrQ).
- Thriving literary scene and scholarship
    - 200-300 Mahakavyas composed in Sanskrit since independence. Total literary output is much more.
    - I myself am in regular contact - in person and electronically - with a quite a few sanskrit scholars of the very high caliber - even more if you consider second degree contacts.
    - Interesting account of sanskrit use from the perspective of western academics, with references: [NLL](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=23412).
- Immortality due to early and respected standardization by the grammarians.
    - As suhAsa says [here](http://swarajyamag.com/columns/verses-which-produce-magic-when-re-read/): "The Rāmāyaṇa is atleast 2500 years old. The hanumannāṭaka came more than 1500 years after it. And more than a millennium later came Rāma Śāstrī. And half a century later came Bacchu Subbarāyagupta. This literary chain may not seem unusual at first glance, yet it is an extraordinary thing to happen in a language. Languages come with lifetimes of less than a millennium. Old English is as intelligible to me as Hebrew. Reading Geoffrey Chaucer is like wading through quicksand. Time will ensure libraries move Shakespeare from the literature section to history section. But frozen in time by the spell of Pāṇini, only Classical Sanskrit will remain untouched. A few hundred years from now, a young boy (or girl), having taught himself Sanskrit, may decide to write a work to top Rāma Śāstrī. The poet to top Kālidasa may well be born a thousand years from now. My own descendants may spend a sunday afternoon, sipping soylent, and laughing at their ancestor’s metrical misadventures. How absurd it is to label such a language dead! Immortal is more like it."

## Hard language.
- Not so - the "grammar translation method" introduced and imposed by the British, and exposure to only hard registers of sanskrit causes this wrong impression. See this [detailed speech](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoS1nA8RVko). With an immersive approach, conversational Sanskrit is as easy as any other language. Of course, advanced/ masterful usage requires serveral years of dedicated effort - like in any other language. \[Funny "Hitler learns Sanskrit" [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv87qb1is9M).\]
- If the right register ([Simple Standard Sanskrit](../../simple_standard) -  [archive](https://archive.org/details/simple-standard-sanskrit/mode/2up)) is used, sanskrit is quite easy for all Indians. \[chamu [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr8iB6cscjM)\] It can be learned in a few days. Samskrita bhArati routinely teaches this.
  - I know idiots who've learned. So have lakhs of people. I know very intelligent people (superspecialized famous doctors) who haven't - despite me taking them to a camp. What matters is simply honesty and the lack of fear of "mistakes" (and looking silly).

### Simple sanskrit is good only for gimmicks.
- Bogus. Besides common sense, direct experience suffices as proof. Just as illiterate rustic villagers selling sheep for slaughter can have "intellectual debates", so can one with simple standard sanskrit.
  - Look at this page - what level of English are we using? SSS easily surpasses. Consider [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9FODBb_b0c) by nidar singh - just contrast the gravity of the concepts he presents with the presentation (level of english used).
  - How good are you/ people debating complex matters with "broken hindI"?
- BTW, this sick attitude is [shared](https://twitter.com/pvaal2/status/1301890398407856128) by none other than Sheldon Bollocks.
- People routinely teach and learn complex jargon-laden concepts such as vedAnta (via bhagavadgIta), vyAkaraNa and nyAya using the Simple Standard Sanskrit register. 
- Open sambhAShaNa sandesha magazines and tell me there's only quotidian stuff there.

### High register not required for shAstra
In fact there is a famous nyAya quote reg. this. to

> In the heat of an argument, the Tārkika says, "इदं तु पटम्!" ("This is a cloth!"). This is incorrect, because "Paṭa" is masculine, and he should have said, "अयं तु पटः".  
> The Vaiyyākaraṇi jumps on this: "कथं कथं पटम् इति?" ("How come you're calling it Paṭam [when it should be Paṭaḥ]?"  
> The Tārkika coolly replies, "घटम् इव पटम्!" ["Paṭam is like the word Ghaṭam!"] This is wrong too -- Ghaṭa is masculine as well!  
> The Vaiyyākaraṇi is flabbergasted, and shouts "कथं कथं घटम् इति?!"
> The Tārkika has a ready answer: "यथं इव घटं, तथं इव पटम्!" Aaargh! He's twisting avyayas also to fit his logic! The words should be यथा and तथा!  
> The Vaiyyākaraṇi plaintively wails, "कथम् कथम्?!!!"  
> Pat comes the reply: "कथम् इव यथं, यथम् इव तथं, तथम् इव घटम्, घटम् इव पटम्". Even 'Katham' has been enlisted, and the poor Vaiyyākaraṇi gives up and asks, "कथं कथं व्याकरणम् एव उल्लङ्घ्यते?" ("You're violating every rule of grammar!")  
> The Tārkika's reply shuts him up permanently: "अस्माकोणां तार्किकेषाम् अर्थनि आसक्तिम्, न तु शब्दरि" (Every word here is wrong -- it should read अस्माकं तार्किकाणाम् अर्थे आसक्तिः न तु शब्दे, "We logicians are interested only in meanings, not in sounds")

### Can't read dramas and texts
Some object: "Simple Sanskrit is like Butler English only less useful. One can't read any classic Sanskrit Dramas, or Kavyas with that knowledge."

- You can be taught classic Sanskrit Dramas, or Kavyas using Simple sanskrit register.
- You can consume lots of modern novels, texts and speeches using Simple sanskrit.

### Simple sanskrit register is a recent fake neo-language.
- "There are several offshoots of Sanskrit that already exist and have evolved organically ... Why engineer a neo-language?"
- Simple standard sanskrit is an organic, well-attested register of the language. Listen to this 1961 radio broadcast - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oH80EHYu4I .

## Restricted social role
- Accusation: Sanskrit is the language of Brahmins, and that too male brahmins. Further, it was only used for shAstra-s and kAvya-s.
- In the past - see note on "history" above, which indicates clear usage outside ritual.  

- There are plenty of Sanskrit scholars (right from upaniShadic seers such as Aitreya mahidAsa to dArA-shikoh / [Abdul Rahim Khan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Rahim_Khan-I-Khana)) who were not brahmaNa-s or kShatriya-s. Eg: mAtanga-divAkara the chaNDAla \[[TW](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/632370949975883776)\]. bhartRmENTa the mahout.
- Sanskrit is also a liturgical language of buddhism, jainism: even Zoroastrians used it when they came to India and recognized the sanskrit-avestan-monophyly! ([Q1](http://www.quora.com/Why-did-Buddhism-and-Jainism-adopted-Prakrit-instead-of-Sanskrit/answer/Vishvas-Vasuki), [YT15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NRLdoV_Vw8&index=69&list=WL))
- shatAvadhAnI gaNesh on this:[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff6mVQ_yn2s). Other examples: Abhinavabharatasarasangraha Mummadi Cikkabhupala (= sippgowDa, a chieftain of Madhugiri, Karnataka),Pedakomati Vemareddy, who wrote an extensive vyAkhyAna to Amaru Shatakam.
- Now foreigners speak and chant Sanskrit quite comfortably ([G15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQg5k1RHitU)).
- rAjashekhara clearly says in Kavyamimamsa 10th chapter:
    - "पुरुषवद्योषितोऽपि कवीभवेयुः । संस्कारो ह्यात्मनि समवैति, न स्त्रैणं वा पौरुषं वा विभागमपेक्षते । श्रूयन्ते दृश्यन्ते च राजपुत्र्यो महामात्रदुहितरो गणिकाः कौतुकिभार्याश्च शास्त्रप्रहतबुद्धयः कवयश्च ।"
- An excerpt from the education of Princess belavADi mallamma, as recorded by Shesho Srinivas Muthalik in 1705 \[[KPP](http://www.kamat.com/database/books/kareducation/appendix_a.htm#_ftnref1)\] \- "When Mallamma reached five years of age, her education began, along with that of her brother Sadashiva Nayaka. Both of them were taught Kannada, Marathi, Urdu, and Sanskrit . It took them ten years to learn all these languages. The brother and sister were very close and studied together. A school was built for their education and ten senior shāstris were appointed as teachers. In the classes there were boys and girls belonging to various castes (Havyaks, Gouda Saraswats, Nadavars, and Madhwas) in about equal numbers. Shankar Bhat was the principal of the school and was a great scholar. Mallamma was a very good student and an intelligent girl. Everybody admired her intellect. She was drawn to poetry when she was about twelve years old. Sadashiva Nayaka was also fond of poetry and wrote poems in Kannada. Their father, king Madhulinga Nayaka arranged for all the boys to undergo military training and appointed a brave man called Ranavir Singh as the trainer. Mallamma showed an interest in fencing and archery. She also equalled the boys in horse riding and throwing the javelin."
- Modern experience with dalits acquiring sanskrit scholarship shows more support than deprecation.
    - Kumud Pawde (Mahar 1960-s [GB](https://books.google.com/books?id=NN48WUBx_54C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA85#v=onepage&q&f=false))

### Sanskrit was forbidden for some jAti-s.
- It is a matter of fact that various religious streams - Hindu Agamas and tantras and jaina/ bauddha traditions - allowed instruction and utilization of sanskrit by adherents irrespective of jAti.
- Some cite a pair of verses from skanda-purANa ("नोच्चरेत् प्रणवं मन्त्रं... न शिखां नोपवीतं च नोच्चरेत् संस्कृतां गिरम्।") and padma-purANa (न‌ शिखी नोपवीती स्यान्नोच्चरेत्संस्कृतां गिरम्). Details [here](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/7aihuwshbl4/m/moEQCAqcAgAJ)). These have been interpreted by medieval dharmashAstra nibandha writers, some of their modern adherents and anti-hindu activists as barring sanskrit speech by certain jAti-s. Note: Some of these dharmashAstra compilers proposed that the "न शिखां नोपवीतं" part to refer to social classes with low religious commitment ('असच्छूद्रपरम्' and 'अपाकृष्टशूद्रपरम्').
  - The latter cannot be traced in current published recensions (though cited by dharmashAstra writers in 17th CE). The former, being followed by "नमस्कारेण मन्त्रेण क्रियासिद्धिर् भवेद् ध्रुवम्" clearly implies that it refers to the use of generic scriptural sanskrit mantra-s should not be used by certain classes of people in the context of rituals (with bountiful exceptions among paurANika and Agama literature).
- The orthodox vaidika/ paurANika tradition forbids the study of particular classes of sanskrit literature (veda-s and their literal meaning) for certain jAti-s. For other categories (purANa-s, smRti-s, itihAsa-s, vedAnga-s), they allow and encourage these jAti-s to hear the lore when recited by a brAhmaNa (in whom the ultimate religious interpretive authority rests). Direct study of particular subsets of these texts was forbidden.
- Orthodox dharmashAstra tradition admits the possibility of change in "dharma" based on changes in circumstance (including time and place). Clearly, the current context, with it's advent of such innovations such as the printing press, social and audio-visual media, mass literacy requires orthodox hindu paurANika tradition to adapt in order to compete with inimical doctrines.

## Caste system
- Claim: "Sanskrit literature reinforces the hindu caste system."
- Why single out Sanskrit epics for this analysis? What about Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, Telugu epics that also reinforce that system? And some counter-religious bauddha and jaina texts? All ancient scholarship (irrespective of language and country), was to a huge degree, elite scholarship.
- Why would you turn a blind eye to mountains of Sanskrit works (hindu, buddhist, jain) which talk nothing about caste or gender roles in a way you dislike?

## Money
- Sanskrit is not the optimal language to learn in order to earn more money. So, we should ditch it and teach German, Chinese, etc.. \[[FP](http://www.firstpost.com/india/speak-german-smriti-iranis-hindutva-agenda-dims-prospects-kendriya-vidyalaya-students-1802783.html)\]
    - Earning more money is not the only reason to teach languages to our children. There are very strong humanistic and aesthetic reasons to favor Sanskrit. If we want diversity in the international languages taught to our children, that is welcome - let them compete with English - not Sanskrit.

## Sanskrit suppresses other (Indian) languages.
- Some languages have an oppressor - oppressed relationship. Eg: Arabic vs Egyptian. English vs Iniut.Though Sanskrit was a link languageacrossAsia,this was not the case with Sanskrit and other languages. Rather, their relationship was of the nourisher-nourished type.
- Ancient local language poets acknowledged their debt to sanskrit and sanskrit literature.
    - Again and again, the Tamil shaiva saints speak of how shiva revealed truth in Aariyam and Tamil. [1](http://www.thevaaram.org/thirumurai_1/songview_en.php?thiru=10&Song_idField=10103&padhi=%20&startLimit=8&limitPerPage=1&sortBy=&sortOrder=DESC), [2](http://thevaaram.org/thirumurai_1/songview.php?Song_idField=50180&limitPerPage=1&padhi=018&sortBy=&sortOrder=DESC&startLimit=3&thiru=5), [3](http://thevaaram.org/en/thirumurai_1/songview.php?thiru=11&Song_idField=11033&padhi=040&startLimit=72&limitPerPage=1&sortBy=&sortOrder=DESC&Submit=Please+go)
- Linguists say that Sanskrit \*borrowed\* from as well as lentwordsto other languages (a hallmark of living languages).
    - Sanskritization is often involved in the process of borrowing.
        - This involves coining newer more Sanskrit words that sound similar to the alien word.
            - Eg. sultan → सुरत्राणः chocolate→ चाकलेहः mughal → मौद्गल। (Hammira-kaavya)
        - Inspiration is drawn from the nirukta and the uNAdi sUtra-s of grammar tolegitimizethe use of these new words.
    - Examples
        - Borrowed words from farsi - कलम। दीनार। (both used by kShemendra)
        - Borrowed from prAkRta-s .
            - भर्ता (Sanskrit) → भट्टा (Prakrit) → भट्ट (Later sanskrit - kShemendra). Similarly, (gRha, geha) and (mUDha, mugdha).
            - kumarIla bhaTTa seems to have argued how words like pika come from prAkRtas.
        - English words and etymological inspiration
            - 92 Hoch study [here](https://archive.org/download/ANoteOnEnglishAndModernSanskritHansHenrichHock).
            - English words appearing in arjunwadekar's poems
- In classical sanskrit aesthetic works (eg: rAjashekhara) the poet is esteemed by his ability to compose in Sanskrit as well as prakrits; and aesthetic quality is considered to be not-very language-dependent. Most examples of very high-quality poetry (dvani-kAvya) in Sanskrit works came from Prakrit, even if the author chose Sanskrit examples for mediocre and poor poetry!!
- In south India there works composed in a mixture of Sanskrit and the local language (eg: maNipravaLa).
- Sanskrit enriched local languages - with its special ability to coin new words.
    - A grateful acknowledgement of influence on Thai - [YTTh2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWp-xyBxWQg).
    - Sanskrit enrichment of telugu - [IF15](http://indiafacts.co.in/samskrutandhramulu-a-symphony-down-the-ages/).
- Works were composed for the study of Prakrits and apabhraMsha-s in Sanskrit (of course, with an intention of \*preserving\* the prAkrits and their treasures). Examples: Hemachandra's 8th chapter, kAshmIra-shabdAnushAsanam, etc..
- References: Balram Shukla's [answer here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvEmb8p0oZA&list=PLPYaOgCOpkjxI0DnNHK9M5e0T8lbTp7h-&t=1545).

## Modern tech terms
- Accusation: You cannot do or teach modern technical subjects (eg. maths, physics, chemistry, biology...) in sanskrit.
- False - You can, and it will be quite precise, meaningful and fun. Example of a brief description of titration and stellar chain reactions - [MT16](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/05/21/svabha%E1%B9%A3aya%E1%B9%83-sastriya-sik%E1%B9%A3a/)([TW16](https://twitter.com/agnimaan/status/769049896922013697)).
- Chinese, Japanese, Israelis and Germans do science in their own languages. Among them, Hebrew is a revived language.
- That said, we can still concede that we can expediently use English for such subjects while retaining sanskrit for the soft sciences.

## Impractical to switch
- It is impractical to switch to using sanskrit as the link language of India.
    - Hebrew example: [WP15](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/09/12/link-language-question-hebrew-revival-and-sanskrit-revival/).
