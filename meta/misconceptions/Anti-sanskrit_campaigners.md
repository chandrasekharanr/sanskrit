+++

- General anti-intellectual idiots. Eg. [NE16](http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2016-09-08/tongue-tied.html)
- Anti hindu groups
    - Various communist groups. Eg. [NE16](http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2016-09-08/tongue-tied.html)
    - Various muslim groups.
    - Various Christian groups.
- Regionalists who are afraid (without much basis, and shortsightedly) that sanskrit popularization will reduce the influence of their regional language.
- Certain academics are against popularization of sanskrit - claiming that it will lower language standards and that it is a gimmick (with the actual reason being that it reduces their speciality and value).
