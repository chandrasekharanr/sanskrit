### Preface to the Third Edition

With the need for a new printing of the Devavāņipraveśikā, we de cided that it would be desirable to produce a new edition, further refining and modifying various grammatical explanations and exercises in the text. Many of the resultant changes arose out of suggestions made by students and colleagues who were using our Sanskrit primer. We are most grateful for their suggestions. Two of the most important changes in this edition are the addition of an English to Sanskrit Glossary as well as an Index. The lack of these has been felt by our students over the years, and we are glad that we have finally been able to address it in this new edition.

We would like to express our very special thanks to Chandan Narayan, graduate student in the Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies, without whose energy and tireless efforts this project never would have been completed. We would also like to thank Richard Lasseigne of the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley for letting us use his fonts, “Devanāgarī” and “Times Nāgarī,” to typeset this edition and for his good-natured help in solving our many technical problems its use entailed. We would also like to thank Deven Patel, a graduate student in the Department of South and South east Asian Studies, for helping us enter the text into the computer. We would also like to express our gratitude to the staff at the Center for South Asia Studies, especially Raba Gunasekara, Choo Hawj Yaj, and Ann Higgins, for their help and support in this project. Finally we would also like to extend a special word of thanks to the students in the 1998 99 first year Sanskrit class, who suffered through the rough draft of the revised text. Their thoughtful and insightful comments and sugges tions have been invaluable in the revision of this work. Special thanks go to Simone Barretta, Karen Beal, Prudence Farrow Bruns, Ami Buch, Mukhesh Darke, Hung Van Ho, Eun-Sun Jang, Hudaya Kandahjaya, Manali Kasbekar, Michael Gressett, Layne Little, Hollis Meyer deLancey, V. Sundararajan, and Kristin Johnston Sutton.

### Preface to the First Edition

No American Sanskritist, or for that matter no student of Sanskrit in America who has suffered through the "traditional," quasi-inductive Whitney-Perry-Lanman method, would question the desirability of new Sanskrit teaching materials. Indeed, the interest in and enthusiasm for such materials that I' have seen on the part of numerous Sanskrit teachers and students is undoubtedly the result of a growing frustration with the limits of the existing materials.

I do not mean to denigrate the work of the above named authors. On the contrary I shall continue to use Lanman as my first reader, while it is clear that, aside from the dated nature of his terminology and the archaism of his style, Whitney has stood the test of time admirably, remaining a valuable reference grammar for Sanskrit and Vedic.

The problem in the teaching of Sanskrit in this country has been simply that books like Whitney's Grammar and Lanman's Reader have, for want of acceptable alternatives, been used for a task to which they are poorly suited. Most students find it at best frustrating and painful to try to learn any language, not to mention a language like Sanskrit, from a reference grammar and from the depressingly small portions of a reader that one can cover in such a first-year course. That some students do manage to continue and ultimately gain some measure of control over the language speaks largely for an enthusiasm and dedica tion on the part of teacher and student which are able to keep them going in spite of the first-year materials. Even those relatively few students who persevere and do well in comparison with their class mates seldom have any usable knowledge of Sanskrit as they enter the second year.

The origins of this problem are, I think, to be found, in part, in the history of Sanskrit in American universities. With a few distinguished exceptions, most American (and European) Sanskritists have come to the study of Sanskrit in a roundabout way. Many have been linguists,philologists or classicists for whom Sanskrit has been a secondary in terest and who, because of their profound knowledge of the classical languages, were able to teach themselves and their students, after a fashion, on the basis of such materials as described above. Others, like some comparative religionists, have come to regard Sanskrit as a "tool" whereby they would be able to get at the "meat” of some circumscribed type of text. For their purposes the traditional" method was adequate.

(The "T" in the preface refers to Robert P. Goldman, who put together the original draft for Devavāṇipraveśikā. In 1980, Sally J. Sutherland (Goldman) was given co-author status.) 

Yet, as professional Indologists know, a mere "working knowledge" of Sanskrit will not do for those who are truly interested in the almost overwhelming richness of India's traditional culture; literary, intellec tual, scientific, and spiritual. For the Sanskrit language is not merely an abstruse code to be cracked laboriously to read a given message. Neither is it solely of interest insofar as it represents a well-preserved example of an old Indo-European language. Rather, it has served as the very medium of much of the finest in India's long and illustrious history of art, science, philosophy, and religion. In its timelessness, in its subtlety, in its delight in the profusion of its own forms, the Sanskrit language is a kind of mirror for the whole of traditional Indian culture. It is no wonder that for classical India the study of grammar was re garded as men's highest intellectual endeavor.

But my intention here is not to write a polemic on the value of San skrit education. Rather, I shall introduce materials which, my experience has shown, can make that education a more efficient and more reward ing experience.

Since I began teaching Sanskrit I have been approached by literally hundreds of students interested in India in Indian literature, religions, and philosophies. Many of these students, though bright and moti vated, had no Greek or Latin, no training in linguistics, and often only a nodding acquaintance with languages other than English. Students like these have been turning up in fair numbers for first year Sanskrit for years, to go on, thanks to the typical 80-90% attrition rate, only in a trickle to more advanced courses. This problem has become more no ticeable in the past few years as more and more students have expressed interest in things Indian.

Potentially good students were dropping out of Sanskrit simply for the want of a clear, self-contained progressive Sanskrit textbook which did not presuppose advanced linguistic or philological training on their part. My aim here has been to provide such a text. My own experience with it, over three years of use, has been most encouraging. I am satis fied that most of my students know, by the end of their first year, as much Sanskrit as I and my contemporaries knew at the end of our sec ond. But the real test of these materials is in the hands of teachers other than the author. It is for them and their students to say how far I have succeeded in my aim.

My purpose, then, in writing this primer, was to provide a self-con tained primer, workbook and reader for teaching first-year Sanskrit to students with no previous linguistic training. The work is not intended to serve as a comprehensive reference grammar of the classical lan guage. There are already a fair number of these, some of which, like Gonda's useful work, are specially aimed at the student of linguistics. Rather, I have tried throughout the work to introduce, explain and il lustrate the most significant features of the language and through verses, quotations, and readings encourage the growing interest in Sanskrit as a means of expression and a medium of a rich culture.

To these ends the grammar has been, in several areas, simplified to prevent the beginner from being more hampered than is absolutely necessary by relatively insignificant paradigms, rules, and exceptions. This does not mean that the course is by any means an easy one. There is all the material that the best students can handle in their first year and much to which the more advanced will wish to return repeatedly. The study of Sanskrit is by its nature demanding and I have accord ingly geared this approach to the student with some natural aptitude for the language.

Upon completion of this course, students should have a real working knowledge of the major outlines of Sanskrit grammar. They should be able to read and compose sophisticated Sanskrit sentences with some facility and read, with dictionary, approximately five to ten verses of the Vālmiki Rāmāyaṇa or a similar text in an hour.

#### Method:

The grammar of classical Sanskrit is, for many reasons, an unusually complex system for students to master. For this reason I have through out this work excluded many rules, exceptions, forms, and grammatical subtleties that I regard as unnecessary for an elementary course. Many of these items occur but rarely and, as such, seem to me to place a strain on the already overburdened memory of the first-year student without repaying the effort required to learn them. This notion has led me to what might be described as a sort of statistical" method whereby I have stressed forms, rules and even lexical items which are statisti cally quite common in texts and in the usage of the pandits and enable the student to express general ideas simply. I have adhered to this practice even when more common and useful forms are themselves exceptions to general rules. Thus, for example, I cite and stress the important, though irregular, root jñā to illustrate the ninth gana. As examples of simplification I have throughout cited verbal roots as be ing either parasmai pada or ātmanepada even in cases in which optional conjugation is permitted by the grammarians. The arrangement of the material in the text was intended to enable the student to increase his repertoire of usable grammatical material steadily. Thus, verbal and nominal paradigms are introduced together, the more common or use ful appearing in the earlier chapters. In addition to this rough functional ordering of the material, the amount of time spent on explanation of the various grammatical features of Sanskrit has been weighted in ac cordance with the degree to which a given formation normally presents conceptual difficulties to the English speaker. Thus, much of the ma terial, even when it is complex, like the gana-s of the present system and the problems of the perfect system, requires a good deal of simple memorization but no special explanation as to usage. On the other hand, it has been my experience that certain issues, especially the na ture of the karmaņi prayoga, the uses of participles and, of course, the formation and application of bahuvrihi compounds are almost always perplexing to my students. I have accordingly spent a proportionately greater amount of time and effort on these forms. This will be clear from an examination of Lessons 13 and 15 where I have preferred the risk of seeming repetitive to the certainty that, without such repetition, the use of the bahuvrihi-s and the present participles will remain mys terious to most students. Pronunciation, Script, Sandhi:

Three issues which deserve special mention here, and form the sub jects of the first three lessons, are pronunciation, script, and sandhi. Teaching the proper pronunciation of Sanskrit is, I think, important. Sanskrit has the distinction of being perhaps the only language in the world which is neither "dead" nor "living." It is a special, timeless language whose recitation, chanting, and even speaking are still much practiced and prized in certain contexts in India. I found in my own case and in the case of my students, the ability to speak and understand spoken Sanskrit has had the twin advantages of increasing the morale and motivation of the students and, partly because of this, noticeably increasing their ability to grasp and internalize the common forms and regular syntactic patterns of the language. Moreover, ability to prop erly pronounce Sanskrit and to correctly recite a few well-known verses and proverbs makes a good impression upon Indian Sanskritists and facilitates what should be a very valuable communication with them.

Pronunciation of Sanskrit is not really very difficult. Only a few points cause serious difficulty for English speakers. On the other hand, it is clearly not possible to master the pronunciation of any language without a proper model. For this purpose, I have been fortunate to have available to me a series of traditionally trained pandits fluent in spoken Sanskrit. This is, alas, not possible at most places where San skrit is taught. For this reason I am preparing, with some pandits, a series of tapes2 for use with the primer. These will serve as a basis for emulation. Until these tapes are obtained, careful study of the material in Lesson I will have to serve, however poorly, to provide the basics of Sanskrit phonology.

2 "Many users have called and written over the years in order to secure copies of the tapes for assistance with pronunciation. These tapes, including a supplement with all the new verses, may be ordered directly from the Language Laboratory, Univer sity of California at Berkeley, 94720."Taken from the Preface to the Second Edition, 1986, p. xvii (SJG 1998).

The issue of the use of the devanāgari script is to my mind a simple one. This text is aimed primarily at students who plan to make some serious use of Sanskrit literature. I have found that failure to introduce the devanāgari script at a very early stage leads to an excessive reli ance on transliteration, which, in many cases has led to a lasting inability to read comfortably what is after all not a very difficult script. In order to avoid this I have introduced the devanā gari script in the second lesson. From that point on until the tenth lesson, forms and examples are given both in nāgari and transliteration. This enables students to become increasingly familiar with the script while they are not depen dent upon it for an understanding of grammar. From the tenth lesson onwards the use of transliteration is abandoned and the student is com pelled to rely upon his knowledge of the script. The readings are given only in nā gari throughout. As a result of this method, I have rarely had a student for whom the script presents any serious problem by the middle of the course.

In the case of sandhi, as with the grammar in general, I have found it useful to minimize or eliminate rules of rare or trivial application. My general purpose in the sandhi lesson (Lesson 3) is to provide the mini mum number of rules for the generation and interpretation of syntactic units. Accordingly, I have stressed the basic rules of external sandhi. It has been my experience that it is very difficult for beginning stu dents to master what, in the absence of any knowledge of the grammar and vocabulary, is an almost wholly abstract system of sound changes. Therefore, except for some important exceptions, I have left many of the individual important issues of internal sandhi to be presented in conjunction with morphological processes in which they figure promi nently.

Thus the treatment of sandhi in this primer, while more than suffi cient for the first-year student, is not intended to be exhaustive or systematic. Such a treatment, however, is to be found in the elegant and useful Sanskrit Sandhi and Exercises of M. B. Emeneau and B. A. van Nooten published by the University of California Press. I recom mend that students work through these exercises after completing those of Lesson 3 and while working through the materials of the following lessons.

#### Use of Sanskrit Grammatical Terminology:

One additional point which requires some comment is the usage of Sanskrit grammatical terminology. I have used this terminology throughout the primer for various reasons. Apart from the interests of classicists and comparative philologists, there seems to me to be no reason whatever to abandon the precise and sophisticated terminology of the Indian grammarians for the poorly adapted and often simply misleading terminology of classical grammars. Forone thing it is some thing of a disservice to the most incisive and accurate tradition of linguistics that the world has known. Indeed, many modern linguists are turning to Sanskrit for its subtle terminology. Moreover, learning the proper terms, like learning proper pronunciation, contributes to the enthusiasm and sense of progress in a new study which is important to student motivation.

In any case the Sanskrit terminology is designed for Sanskrit gram mar. Many of the terms (e.g., tatpuruşa, bhūte krdanta, etc.) are themselves examples of the forms they designate. On the other hand, Western terminology is frequently confusing. Thus, we have been taught to contrast active and passive voice as well as active and middle when the term "active" represents two completely different concepts. The term "past passive participle" is used to indicate a form which is by no means always "passive." Indeed, with regard to something like the issue of "passive" to "active" transformation, the whole idea of subject and object which we learn in school is rather different from that expounded by the Sanskrit grammarians. To avoid confusion on the part of those who have had some Sanskrit previously, I have al ways given the Western term alongside the Sanskrit term. I suggest, however, that the latter be used. A glossary of Sanskrit grammatical terms has been provided.

For similar reasons I have given paradigms to be learned in the tradi tional Indian fashion rather than in the usual Western way. One additional reason for this is that it seems, especially in the case of nomi nal declension, simpler to learn groups of three (one case at a time) than to try to get sets of seven (one number at a time) by heart.

#### A Note on Vocabulary:

The vocabulary of Sanskrit presents a serious problem to the learner. First of all he is deprived of the help of the many cognates so easily recognizable in European languages. Moreover, the lexicon of San skrit is extremely large. There is a great deal of true synonymity while homonyms abound. Indeed, the whole problem is made more complex by the fact that each different type of text has, to a large extent, its own specialized vocabulary. For the second-year student these problems become dominant; however, as I think that the first duty of the begin ner is to master the grammar, I do not place any great emphasis in the first year on vocabulary acquisition. I have found that students will manage to learn a fair working vocabulary from the readings in this text and are able to summarize the story as they go along with little difficulty. Nonetheless, the grammar is ample material for the begin ner and accordingly, I usually provide a small glossary for all words that I feel the students do not know readily, on all quizzes and exami nations. Use of the Primer:

This primer is intended to provide material for approximately the -first twenty weeks of an elementary Sanskrit course. The actual rate at which a class is able to move through the lessons will vary somewhat with the circumstances, number of hours per week, etc. The course has been designed to cover the first two of three ten-week quarters of First Year Sanskrit at the University of California at Berkeley. This class meets for 41/2 hours per week. I have also used the same mate rial for a special ten-week intensive course which met for 15 hours per week. In general a rate of one lesson per week should be about right but time should be allowed for frequent review and, in any case, there is no point in rushing a class through the material. Each class will find its own rate. Each lesson from Lesson Four to Lesson Twenty-one consists of rules and forms illustrated with Sanskrit examples and ex plained so that the student may follow the rationale behind the rules. Each lesson is followed by a series of exercises consisting of practice in translation from Sanskrit to English and English to Sanskrit and various types of grammatical drill. A special feature of the primer is that each of these lessons is followed by a graded reading passage which specially illustrates the forms introduced in that particular chapter while providing increasingly sophisticated use of previously acquired mate rial. These readings are also of cultural value as they form, together, a concise retelling of the main story of the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa from the curse of Dasaratha to the abduction of Sītā. The readings of the later lessons incorporate more and more verses from the epic text itself, while Lesson Twenty-two consists wholly of a selection of verses which complete the epic tale.

Exercises and reading should be assigned daily and may be broken up into whatever units are deemed advisable. I have found it advisable to have students read a little ahead of the material being covered in class and in the homework.

In the later chapters I have provided some verses from various works of Sanskrit literature. These generally illustrate some of the grammar of the lessons in which they appear. They are to be memorized for classroom recitation and this, along with reading from the Rāma story, should be drilled regularly in class.

I have also found it useful to have students keep current their own short version of the main elements of the Rāma story to be read and discussed in class.

Quizzes should be frequent, not less than every two or three lessons. When the primer is completed, the rest of the first year should be used to build vocabulary and grammatical skills by reading and practicing composition. Lanman's reader is very useful for this purpose, espe cially his selections from the Hitopadeśa and the Kathāsaritsāgara. I have found it entertaining and very helpful to ask the students to write their own brief Hitopadeśa stories based on the characters and situa tions of the selections chosen from Lanman. If the students are quick and desire some variety, they may be given some Rāmāyaṇa or Mahābhārata (especially Gitā) towards the end of the year.

### Acknowledgments

A work of this kind owes much to many people; my teachers, my colleagues, and my students. Many teachers have inspired and guided me in my Sanskrit studies. Among these my debt is greatest to Dr. W. Norman Brown who set, by his scholarship and kindness, an example easy to admire, impossible to emulate. Pandit Śrīnivāsa Šāstri of the Deccan College, with his profound learning and flawless Sanskrit, has been a constant inspiration. Professors Emest Bender and Ludo Rocher of the University of Pennsylvania through teaching and guidance pre pared me in many ways to undertake this work. Special mention must be made of Professor Royal Weiler who first introduced me to the in tricacies and frustrations of sandhi and the other terrors of Sanskrit which I have inflicted, in turn, on a new generation of Sanskritists.

My colleagues at the University of California have always been ready to examine and discuss this work as it took shape and it has benefited greatly from the suggestions of them all. Professor Murray Emeneau was kind enough to read through the first draft and made a number of helpful suggestions. My associate Vidvan Vinayaka Parameshwara Bhatta worked through these materials in class with me three times and has on innumerable occasions given me the benefit of his advice in matters of grammar and style. The present work owes much to his careful reading. Finally, I find it difficult to express fully my gratitude to my teacher, friend and colleague, Professor V. W. Paranjpe of Poona University. While teaching at the University of California at Berkeley during the academic year 1973-1974, Dr. Paranjpe read through the manuscript several times. His never-failing counsel, based on his mas every aspect of Sanskrit language and literature, enabled me time and again to clarify, for myself as well as my students, a number of diffi culties in the following chapters and, especially, in the reading selections.

If this work has been inspired by my teacher and encouraged by my colleagues, still it is to my student that it owes its existence and to whom it is dedicated. It was through working with many students at the Universities of Rochester and California that I realized the pressing nature of the need for new Sanskrit teaching materials. All my stu dents have encouraged me in my desire to provide such materials and borne with me patiently while serving as guinea pigs in this experi ment. They have suffered cheerfully through missing glossary entries, misnumberings, and opacities of presentation in the working draft. That they have maintained their enthusiasm through all this and still man aged to learn Sanskrit in an efficient fashion is, I think, a tribute to their dedication. My thanks to all of them. A number of my students have taken on the special burden of helping with the actual preparation of the text. They have worked efficiently and creatively in the most diffi cult circumstances, presses by deadlines, working with difficult materials and still carrying on their own school work with distinction. Reed Slatkin took on the task of editing and typing the first draft from my minimally legible handwritten copy and carried it out with his typi cal enthusiasm and energy. Matthew Kapstein corrected the copy and wrote out, in a clear and elegant hand, all the devanāgari for the first working text. Both these men offered many valuable suggestions and corrections. Their job was particularly hard as I was teaching from the text all the time forcing them to meet copy-service and classroom dead lines week after week. The devanāgari for the corrected copy was written by Denis Lahey who also assisted with the revision and expan sion of the exercises. Cynthia Dzendzel had perhaps the hardest job of all. Knowing no Sanskrit she managed to type the final copy from a seemingly incoherent mass of corrections, and revisions full of San skrit transliteration, with a speed and accuracy that were truly remarkable.

Finally, I should like express my gratitude to the South and South east Asia Center of the University of California, and to its most recent directors—Professors Warren Ilchman, Eugene Irschick, and Bruce Pray for providing support without which this work would simply not have been possible.

## 01 Phonology

1.0

The Sanskrit language, like any other natural language, has for its irreducible units a series of articulable sounds. These can be represented by a series of abstract graphic symbols. There are various systems of such symbols (scripts), but the one with which we will be chiefly concerned is known as the devanāgari (or nāgari) lipi (script), the vehicle of the overwhelming ma jority of printed Sanskrit texts. There are two interesting features of this script and the phonetic system of Sanskrit that make them in some ways easier to learn and memorize than English and its use of the roman script. The first of these features is that in the devanāgari script, there is a one to one correspondence between each distinct graphic symbol and a unique phonetic symbol. Thus, each “letter" of the script corresponds to one and only one sound. Compare English and its roman script where, for example, the symbol "a" may indicate many sounds, and where the symbols "c" and "s" may indicate the same sound. The second and more significant of the features of the Sanskrit phonetic (and graphic) system is the fact that it is unique among all the world's languages (with the exception of those languages whose systems are derived from Sanskrit) in having its sounds (and by 1.1 necessarily its script) systematically arranged on a scientific basis. The Sanskrit phonetic system, then, consists of some forty nine discrete sounds, represented by an equal number of discrete symbols. The sounds are divided into two basic types: svara, or "sounded," corresponding to "vowels," or syllabic sounds, and vyañjana, or "manifesting," corresponding to "consonants," which cannot, without a sound of the svara group, form an articulable syllable. The svara sounds are twelve in number arranged in six pairs, each of which is distinguished by a short-long altenation, which is one of the chief characteristics of the sound pattern of classical Sanskrit. The svara sounds (vowels) are:

a ā

1.6

–

ai

au

1.7

0 Each pair is produced at the same point of articulation in the vocal apparatus, but the occlusion, or closing of the stream of breath at each point is minimal. The first four pairs of vowels are called simple (śuddha) vowels, while the remaining two pairs (e, ai, o, au) are said to be complex (samyukta). (See 1.18.a for pronunciation.) The vyanjana sounds likewise are of a number of types. The greatest number of the consonants fall into a series of five sets each consisting of five sounds. The sets, or varga-s, are arranged by point of contact (sparśa) in the vocal apparatus and consist of four ordered sounds, each characterized by a high degree of occlusion at a given point, and one corresponding nasal. Such occlusive sounds are sometimes called "stops." The groups are defined by their points of articulation (sthāna). These points range from the back to the front of the vocal apparatus. The points of contact are: the velum (kantha), soft palate (tālu), hard palate (mūrdhan), teeth (danta), and lips (ostha). The series is then, in order: kanthya (velar) or “ka" varga, tālavya (palatal) or "ca" varga, mūrdhanya (retroflex) or "ta" varga, dantya (dental) or "ta" varga, and oșthya (labial)

1.8

1.9

1.10

or "pa" varga, named either for the point of articulation or the initial sound in each series. Except for the nasal that belongs to each varga, the sounds within each varga are differentiated in accordance with the presence or absence of two phenomena: voicing (or the use of the vocal chords) and aspiration (or a concomitant strong explosion of breath in their articulation). The order of the occurrence of these phenomena is the same in all the varga-s. If V stands for voicing and A for aspiration and (+) and (-) indicate respectively presence and absence of the phenomena, the order in the varga-s is as follows:

(-V-A) (-V+A) (+V-A) (+V+A] The varga-s then are: (with vowel "a" to permit articulation)

-V-A -V+A +V-A +V+A NASAL 1. kanthya ka kha ga gha na 2. tālavya ca cha ja jha ña 3. mūrdhanya ţa ţha da dha ņa 4. dantya ta t ha da dha na 5. oșthya . pa pha ba bha ma Most of these sounds occur in some environments in the various dialects of English. Thus, for example, most English speakers habitually use a somewhat retroflex "t" and "d." Others use a more dental "t" and "d," but since no one English dialect is apt to use both (i.e., make a distinction), some care is required in learning to distinguish, both in hearing and speaking, the two different series. (See 1.186.1.c-d for pronunciation.) The other major problem that English speakers are likely to encounter with the sparsa-sounds arises from the juxtaposition of the phenomena of voicing and aspiration. English speakers maintain distinctions of aspiration and non-aspiration, but these distinctions are intimately related to the question of voicing and position. Thus, for example, non-voiced stops (sparśa-s) in English are generally aspirated when in word-initial position,

1.11

1.12

1.13 1.14

1.15

and non-aspirated when in other positions; (e.g., pot vs. spot). This makes initial voiceless non-aspirated stops and non-initial aspirated voiceless stops (both of which occur in Sanskrit) tricky for English speakers. Similarly, aspirated voiced stops, which never occur in English, are a little difficult at first for English speakers. These sounds "gha," "ha," "dha," "dha," and "bha" must be realized (despite their roman representation) each as one simple sound: a voiced stop accompanied by a discharge of air. They are not to be pronounced as two separate sounds, stop plus voiced “h.” (See 1.18.b.1 for pronunciation.) The remaining vyañjana-s fall into two small groups. The first is known as antaḥstha, or "in between," that is, between the vowels and consonants (semivowels). These are "ya," "ra," "la," and "va" and are associated with the tālavya, mūrdhanya, dantya, and oșthya varga-s, respectively. (See

1.18.b.2 for pronunciation.) The final group of consonants is called ūşman, "heated," or subjected to friction (sibilants). These are (back to front) “sa" (tālavya), sa" (mūrdhanya), “sa" (dantya) and "ha." ("ha," a member of the kanthya varga, is not in the usual order of back to front.) (See 1.18.b.3 for pronunciation.) It is important to distinguish, in reading and writing, the palatal sibilant (s) from the retroflex sibilant (s) although, in fact, they are not often clearly distinguished in speech.

The other sounds of Sanskrit are a nasalization of vowels called anusvāra(m), and a slightly velarized aspiration called visarga (h). (See 1.18c for pronunciation.) Note on pronunciation The pronunciation of Sanskrit is usually not very difficult for English speakers. The few exceptions to this rule simply require a little practice. It is, of course, impossible to learn proper pronunciation from a printed page alone. This must be learned either from a teacher whose pronunciation is good or from taped materials designed for this purpose. However, a few guidelines

here will serve to clarify the basic pronunciation of the sounds of Sanskrit as used by fluent speakers of Sanskrit in most parts of India. English examples are based on hypothetical "dictionary” pronunciation. a. svara sounds The svara sounds, with the exception of the “long” samyukta sounds (ai and au), are always pronounced with a single clear effort like the vowels of standard Italian and are not, like many English vowel sounds, allowed to glide into diphthongal sequences. Long vowels are generally held about twice as long as their corresponding short vowels.

pronounced like the u in “but” pronounced like the o in “mom" pronounced like the i in "bit" pronounced like the ee in “beet" pronounced like the first u in "suture" pronounced like the oo in "pool" pronounced like the ri in "rig” is rare in Sanskrit and has no English équivalent. It is pronounced like ? but the sound is held approximately twice as long. pronounced somewhat like the "lur” in “slurp." pronounced like the a in "gate" pronounced somewhat like the i in "high.” This sound is diphthongized to glide slightly into an

"i" vowel. o pronounced like the o in “rote" au pronounced somewhat like the ou of “loud”

with a similar lip-rounding glide. b. vyanjana sounds Pronunciation of the sparsa sounds is problematic for English speakers chiefly because of the first and fourth item in each varga. The second item is tricky only in some environments. The first (non-voiced, non-aspirated) occurs commonly enough

31 .

in English, but never in word initial position. Such sounds occur, however, in all positions in Sanskrit. Thus some difficulty arises when they occur in initial position. Try to resist the natural (English) tendency to aspirate these sounds. When they are properly distinguished from their aspirated equivalents, they will at first sound almost like their corresponding voiced non-aspirates. Practice will clarify this issue. The second sound in each varga (non-voiced, aspirated) is the same sort of sound given to initial non-voiced stops in English. Be sure, however, not to lose the aspiration in non initial occurrences (e.g., sthūla). The third sound in each varga (voiced, non-aspirated) should present no special difficulty to English speakers. The fourth sound in each varga (voiced, aspirated) is of a type that does not really occur in English in any position, hence no English equivalents have been given. Try to repeat these sounds as you hear them from your teacher or from tapes. Remember to give the sounds both voicing and the same strong aspiration that you normally give to the non voiced stops in initial position. 1. sparsa sounds

k like the k in "skate" kh like the k in "Kate"

and "d" sounds of most English dialects but the tip of the tongue should be curled back further to the roof of the mouth for the proper Sanskrit pronunciation.

like the first t in "start" th like the first t in "tart"

like the d in "dart"

like the n in "tint" d. dantya varga: These sounds, which occur in place of

the preceding in the speech of many New Yorkers, are realized with the tip of the tongue protruding slightly between the teeth. The sounds thus produced are characteristically “flatter" and less resonant than those of the preceding varga. The same English examples may be used, since no English dialect has both series

of sounds. e. oșthya varga:

p like the p in "spin"

like the p in "pin" b like the b in "bin"

m like the m's in “mumps" 2. antaḥstha sounds:

like the y in "yellow" r a fronted, mūrdhanya sound, rather like the r in

"drama" like the l in "lug" produced generally with just the slightest contact between the upper teeth and the lower lip; slightly greater than that used for English w (as in “wile") but

less than that used for English v (as in "vile") 3. ūşman sounds

Ś like the sh in “shove"

produced with the tongue-tip further back in the mūrdhanya position) than for the śș, but giving a very similar sound. like the s in "so" like the h in "hope.” Make sure that the sound is fully voiced.

c. additional sounds The following two sounds, although they frequently are the forms taken by certain consonants in certain environments, are not, themselves, consonants. Rather they generally are to be regarded as "colorations" of a preceding vowel. 1. m anusvāra: This sound is realized by permitting the air

used in the articulation of a preceding vowel to escape through the nose. If, however, the anusvāra is immediately followed by a sparsa consonant, it will be realized as the nasal belonging to the same varga as that consonant: e.g., vanam gacchati would be

pronounced "vanañ gacchati." 2. h visarga: The visarga is an aspiration of a preceding

vowel and is pronounced, almost like an echo, as an "h" followed by the short form of the preceding vowel. The samyukta vowels e ando will echo as themselves, respectively. After long samyukta vowels, the "echo" vowel will be the short form of the simple vowel corresponding in point of articulation to the samyukta vowel. Thus, for ai the "echo" will be i, while for au, the echo will be u. The following are some examples. Echo sounds are put in brackets. devah

pronounced as deva(ha) devāh

pronounced devā(ha) muniḥ

pronounced muni(hi) dhīh

pronounced dhi(hi) vişnuḥ pronounced vişnu(hu) muneh pronounced mune(he) devaih pronounced devai(hi) Note: These "echo" or "ghost syllables" are not truly syllabic in a word or line. Often, when visarga occurs within a word, the “echo” is not clearly articulated. In this case it is audible just as a slight "hiss" of air at the velum.1.19

Stress Stress accent, while perhaps not as important in Sanskrit as in English, is usual in proper pronunciation. The general rule is that the penultimate syllable (next to last) receives mild stress if it is as heavy (guru—see 17.6.c.i). If the penultimate is light (laghu—see 17.6.c.i), the stress falls on the syllable that pre cedes it (antepenultimate) regardless of its weight. Secondary stress is not usual, all the remaining syllables receive equal

stress. Example: vikramorvasiya (penultimate heavy) rāmáyana

(penultimate light)

## 02 The देवनागरी Script

2.0

2.1

Learning the nāgari script is made somewhat simpler by the fact noted above (1.1) of each letter's representing one, and only one, phonetic entity.

The script with its correct transliteration is as follows: FC (svara):

अ = a …


औ = au *This sound, vocalic !, is articulated as an 1 preceding the vowel s. It is almost non-existent in Sanskrit and you need not be too concerned with it.

(see 1.18.c) Notice that the script typically frames the distinctive portion of a given letter with a vertical and a horizontal line (1).

152 37 (ja) 11 12 9(pa) 1 a 12 a(va) 19 12 (bha) Note that in the list of nāgari symbols, each consonant has been transliterated with the vowel "a" (37) although this is not indicated in the script. Herein lies the basis and the central peculiarity of the devanāgari writing system; i.e., that the vowel "a" (31), by far the most frequently recurring vowel in Sanskrit, is considered, without any graphic representation, to follow every consonant symbol unless it is otherwise indicated. This fact explains in whole or in part, the use of the three most striking and initially confusing features of the script: (1) the use of vowel signs, (2) the non-vowel sign or virāma, and (3) conjunct consonants. Vowels and vowel signs. The symbols for the svara, or vowel sounds, are given in order at 2.1 above. A major peculiarity of the system is that these signs are used only in those cases in which a vowel begins a syllable (regard less of word boundary) and does not form a part of a syllable begun by a preceding consonant. (See below 2.23.)

2.4

In cases in which a vowel does not begin a syllable, and these form the greatest majority of instances, the vowels are each represented by a special post-consonantal ligature or symbol. Sanskrit's most commonly occurring vowel, “31 (a)," has no post-consonantal symbol and is assumed after every conso nantal sign if not otherwise indicated (2.3). Thus the simple sign for any consonant is to be read as that consonant followed by a. So t = ka, 7 = ca, y = ya, 9 = gha, etc. The word oda is to be read as kavaca. The word Te is to be read as gagana. The post-consonantal forms for the other vowels replace "a." They are as follows: (All are shown with the consonant "F" to indicate proper placement.)

310;pka

Foto; kū #+ ; k;


→ ;*-kai 317 → ;ko 31 ; kau

*See note to 2.1 Note that in the case of the vowel symbols themselves, there is a general typological similarity between long and short vowel signs of the same point of articulation. Keeping this in mind will aid memorization. One or two points concerning the post-consonantal vowel signs require special attention. a. By far the greatest source of confusion, especially in the

writing of the script, is the fact that the post-consonantal sign for 3, f("i") is written "before," i.e., to the left of the consonant it follows, despite the fact that the vowel sound follows the consonant.

D

2.10

2.11

2.12

2.13

b. The subscribed signs ( ),(,) and (.) are written in

special form or placed in special juxtaposition with a few consonants. i. Thus, the "u" signs (,) and ( ) are attached at the

right middle of the consonant ? (r), while the short

sign is inverted. Thus ru, rū. ii. The vowel "" sign is very closely combined with the

consonant & d; thus & dr. iii. It is also placed peculiarly in juxtaposition with <-h;

thus -hr. Thus far, the issue of writing post-consonantal vowels is clear. A consonant is written and read as being followed by a vowel "a" unless it is marked by the sign for another vowel.

The simplest way of indicating a consonant not followed by a vowel is to append to the consonant a short stroke, called virāma, which signals the elision of the inherent vowel "a." Thus 2-t; pad; * rc; etc. This sign is sometimes used in printed texts to separate words when a word boundary falls within a conjunct, but is generally restricted in use to the elucidation of particularly complex conjuncts (e.g., 452 or 47 (pañktyā]) and to marking consonants that occur in absolute final position. (See below 3.25.) Consonant sequences. (Conjunct consonants) The zero form of the non-syllable-initial"a" vowel, which lends a certain elegance to the nāgari system of writing, creates, at the same time, a problem in the script-realization of sequences of consonants with no intervening vowel.

This problem is handled by the script in an ingenious but slightly clumsy manner. Only the final consonant of a sequence ap pears in its full form while only the distinctive portions of the earlier members of the sequence are prefixed to it.

2.14

2.15

17

2.16

2.17

2.18

2.19

Thus, if we wish to properly write the sequence "tva," we can not write ala as this would yield "tava." The proper method then is to take the distinctive portion of a, that is 5, and prefix it to the 7. Thus, the proper result is a "tva." Most conjunct clusters are transparent and are evidently the lateral or vertical sequences of distinctive portions of conso nants prefixed to the final member of the cluster. Consonants, like 47,7,7, etc., which have their distinctive portion well to the left of the vertical line, tend to form hori zontal (i.e., left to right) conjuncts with similar following consonants. For example,

त्म-tma, क्व—kva, भ्य–bhya, स्थ—stha,

Fl-sya, Fa-sva, 24tya, -hya, etc. . When final members of a cluster have a chiefly vertical axis (distinctive portion on, on both sides of, or in place of the ver tical line) or have a horizontal axis, but occupy only a small vertical space compared to the height of the full vertical line (e.g., 9, , ,, etc.), the cluster may be written vertically. For example,

प्ति—pti, धो—ddho, ष्ट-sta, ट—tta. In general, read the clusters as they are written, i.e., left to right and top to bottom. A few consonants have special reduced or altered forms when they occur in conjunction with other consonants. These re quire special note. a. Hś, when followed by a consonant, with which it com

bines vertically (see 2.19) (and, irregularly, by a subscribed

vowel sign) is generally changed to 4. For example,

1śca, 8-śva, (and 4śu, L śr) but 4śya, 34–śma. b. 3-ra has two peculiar forms when in conjunction depend

ing upon whether it is first or non-first in a conjunct.

2.20

2.21

2.22

i. When first, it appears as a superscribed hook, which is

always written as far to the right as possible over the last member of the conjunct or the last member's vowel sign, whichever is farthest right. If, however, the syl lable of which the "r" is the initial, ends in anusvāra, the sign for this will appear within the hook. So arthaḥ-370: ; arthi—3741; dharme—UH; svargam

Fol. ii. When other than first, it appears as a straight line be

low and to the left of the letter it follows, rising about 45° from the horizontal. So pra—; kri— . Note: under a few letters, like 7 and 7, this appears as

gra, țhra. c. t, when preceding another 7, is reduced to a simple

line 7 tta. It is similarly reduced when followed by 3.

Thus 7-tra. There are two common conjuncts that provide no apparent clue to their composition. These are 7-jña, and 8 kşa. These must simply be learned as special forms." Note that Sanskrit is written syllabically as well as by words, and so it is the common practice not to separate words written in a sentence or unit of verse unless the word boundary coin cides with a syllable boundary. A syllable (37872—akşara) is generally considered to be either a single vowel, or a conso nant (or consonant cluster) followed by a vowel. The vowel in either case may be nasalized (377car-anusvāra) or aspirated (fari-visarga). Thus, for example, the famous utterance of the Chāndogya Upanişad, tat tvam asi, "you are that," would be syllabified as ta-, ttva-, ma-, -si. Since no word boundary corresponds to a syllabic boundary, it then would be written in ATRI (nāgari) as Taula. In the same way, if a word final consonant precedes a word initial vowel, the two will form a single syllable and the vowel will take its post-consonantal sign, if any.

2.232.24

Examples: agnir asmy aham 31f444641 (I am fire.) syllabically a-gni-ra-smya-ham gām ānaya 1464 (Bring a cow.) syllabically gā-mā-na-ya However, in the very common case in which a word ending in a vowel (with or without विसर्ग-visarga [h] or अनुस्वार anusvāra (ml) precedes a word beginning with a consonant or in certain cases (see 3.21) a vowel, word boundary is indi cated, since it coincides with a syllable boundary. Thus, matsyā iva jana nityam bhakşayanti parasparam would be written:

| 59 H FR 444 1 (Like fish, men always are devouring one another.) Here all the word boundaries happen to coincide with syllable boundaries. Words are separated in roman transliteration. Except where (for reasons discussed at 3.3-4) a single roman letter obscures the point of word boundary. For example, 114771 and 3264 would be transliterated as gām ānaya and agnir aham. But

TAPES (<14 + 371118) must be transliterated as rāmāgaccha since we cannot break up the roman symbol ā (see 3.3). The Gare (devanāgari) numerals, which are, in fact, the source of our "arabic" numerals, are:

१ २ ३ ४ ५ ६ ७ ८ ९ ०

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 They are used in exactly the same way as our numbers. Thus 280&5 24,068.

A sign (5), called 31946 (avagraha) or separation, is often used to separate words whose initial "a" or "ā" vowel has been lost or has combined with another vowel from words that precede them. It is represented in transliteration as apostrophe () in place of the missing letter. For example, act: + 3714 → pont 544 (3.35), is transliterated as, “kāko 'yam.” (This is a crow.)

3.0

3.1

Perhaps the most peculiar, and initially dismaying, feature of Sanskrit is its complex system of conditional phonological change known as U (sandhi), or combination. Various kinds of environmentally conditioned change occur in all languages, but no other has so formalized and systematized them as has

Sanskrit. There are two basic applications of the afu (sandhi) rules, depending on the circumstances under which the sound changes occur. Many of the same rules hold for both applications. The first historically and morphologically more significant appli cation applies to the junctures of the morphemes, or meaningful parts of words. This is called internal fu (sandhi). Less, perhaps, in historical significance, but of greater importance for the beginner, is the external Hiu (sandhi), which occurs at word boundaries and between members of compounds. With out familiarity with the rules of external HPU (sandhi), it is impossible to read or understand a Sanskrit sentence.

Therefore, while all HU (sandhi) changes are of interest, it is essential, at the outset, to learn the rules for external Hut (sandhi) and a few internal HU (sandhi) rules of common application. Let's examine the rules as they apply first to vowels and then to consonants. External Vowel Hau (sandhi) In general, the basic rule governing vowel amu (sandhi), in internal as well as external combination, is that two vowels should not come into direct contact. That is to say, except in a few cases (see 3.21), vowel hiatus is avoided. It is avoided by the collapse of the two juxtaposed vocalic syllables into one. This in turn may be accomplished in three ways: the coales cence of the two vowels into one, the change of the prior vowel

3.2

to a consonant, which then forms a single syllable with the

remaining vowel, or by the loss of one of the vowels. 3.3 Coalescence

The simplest kind of coalescence, or at any rate the easiest to remember, involves like vowels. Any two concurrent simple vowels of the same pair of long-short alterates (a, i, u, r), regardless of the length of either one, coalesce to form the long vowel of the set. Vowel length is not an issue, as any such sequence yields a long vowel.

Examples: 37 + 31 311; 7441 + HE + 3HITE + Hal 144 HEMTECHIATI a + a + ā; rāmeņa saha agacchat sītā rāmeņa sahāgacchat sītā.

31 + 371 → 31; 17701 + WE + 3M|Tela + Ftal → HENTER diten i a + ā ā; rāmeņa saha āgacchati sītā rāmeņa sahāgacchati sītā.

311 + 31 311; Fidell + 37110T +91971 HANDGATTI ā + a → ā; sītayā agacchat sumitrā sītayāgacchat sumitrā.

311 + 371 +371; Hell + 371e8fà + 274: Toula 27: 1 ātā →ā; sitayā āgacchati rāmaḥ sitayāgacchati rāmaḥ.

In the same way, any two concurrent"I" vowels, long or short, yield “7," and any two concurrent"u" vowels, long or short, yield “ū." Examples:

TO + sta + ata → orifa asta gacchāmi + iti + vadati → gacchāmīti vadati. (“I'm going," he says.)

976 +3714 → 9TH (supreme Kuru) kuru + uttama → kurūttama (supreme Kuru)

3.4

Coalescence may also occur as a result of the contact of two dissimilar vowels but only if the prior vowel is an "a" vowel (a or ā). Here again, the length of the two vowels is immaterial to the result.

25

Examples:

311 + $ → C; HEI + $07 → HERI ā + i +e; mahā + īsa — mahesa (great lord)

31 +3 → 317; (+ + 3G → CESTE a + u → o; lamba + udara lambodara (pot belly)

371 + # → 3R ; HET + #19 → HET ā +ị → ar, mahā + sși → maharși (great sage)

31 + 2; 39 + 9 + 3a a+e → ai; atra + eva → atraiva (right here)

31 + - €; TEU + taraft → Torfi a + ai → ai; gaccha + aišvaryam →gacchaiśvaryam. (Become a sovereign.) 311 + 317 → 31; H + 3116i vafa → Htaci gefa ā +0 → au; să + odanam pacati — saudanam pacati. (She cooks rice.)

31 + 371 → 3it; 4588 + 3t czek4 → YENİG=64 1 a +au → au; yaccha + audumbaram →yacchaudumbaram. (Give the udumbara fruit.)

3.5

Note that the complex vowels (ai) and 31 (au) may be re garded as the “long” form of the complex vowels (e) and 37 (o), respectively. Since length is the maximal grade, the coa lescence of 31 (a) with either the short or long form yields the long form. Vowel Strength Closely related to the results of the previous series of coalescences, although not identical, is a system of vowel grade or strength which is pervasive in Sanskrit and must be learned. The two grades of vowel strength are called Jul (guņa) and al (vrddhi). These grades are similar to the coalescence in

3.6

26

3.4, except that they distinguish vowel length of the strength ___ened "a" vowel. गुण (guna) increases the अ (a) vowel, as it

were, by short 31 (a), and area (vrddhi) by 311 (ā). गुण (guna) and वृद्धि (vrddhi) apply only to the simple vowels and are as follows: स्वर अ,आ svara a, ā i, i u, ū गुण अ,आ ए ओ अर् guna a,a

उ,ऊ

ār

3.8

वद्धि आ ऐ औ आर vrddhi ā

ai Note that the extremely common vowel 37 (a) (short) is un changed in lui (guna). This is sometimes expressed by the statement: अ (a) is its own गुण (guna).

This series of changes is extremely important, especially in internal HU (sandhi) processes of word derivation, and must be learned immediately and thoroughly. When two dissimilar vowels are juxtaposed and the first is not an "a" vowel (long or short), the syllabic coalescence is ef fected by changing the first vowel into its corresponding homorganic nonsyllabic semivowel. The correspondences are: इ/ई→ य् (i/i →y); 3/ऊ → व् (u/j →v); ऋ/ऋ → र् (r/r →r) Examples:

आगच्छामि + अहम् → आगच्छाम्यहम् । āgacchāmi + aham →āgacchāmy aham. (I am coming.)

3.9

जयतु + आर्यपुत्रः → जयत्वार्यपुत्रः । jayatu + aryaputrah → jayatv aryaputrah. (May my lord be

victorious.)

पितृ + ईप्सितम् → पित्रीप्सितम् pitr + ipsitam → pitr ipsitam (...desired by the father)

27

3.10

Complex Vowels The complex vowels, which are, as we can now see, vocalic sounds that may be analyzed into other vowel sounds, betray their complex form when juxtaposed with a vocalic sound (simple or complex). To understand this process, it is essential to have a clear idea of the structure of the complex vowels. Keep in mind that:

3.11

(e) is the joi (guņa) of 3/$ (i/i) and represents 37 + 3/$ (a + i/i) (ai) is the area (vrddhi) of 3/ (i/i) and represents 311 + 3/(ā + i/i)

(guna) of 3/31 (u/ū) and represents 37 + 3/3 (a + u/ū) 31 (au) is the ate (vrddhi) of 3/5 (u/ū) and represents 371 +3/5 (ā+u/ū)

31 (o) i

3.12

3.13

Now, when one of these four complex vowels occurs immedi ately before a vowel sound and is juxtaposed with it, two processes, as it were, take place: a) the complex vowel is analyzed into its components, and b) the final "i" or "u" element of that analysis is changed into

its corresponding semivowel. Clear examples from internal Hu (sandhi): a. The analysis of the word PC (jayatu—May he be victo

rious; 3.9, ex. 2) is as follows: The vowel of the verbal root to (ji-conquer, be victorious) is, for reasons to be learned later (see 7.14), subjected to Jul (guņa) in the for mation of the stem required here. Thus fh (ji je). When the < (e) is juxtaposed with the 37 (a) of the class marker, the following steps occur (although only the final result is evident):

+ 31 (31 + 3) + 31; (31 + 3) + 34 → 37 + 4 + 37 e+a → (a + i) + a; (a +i) + a + a + y +a

so: 5 + 37 + 5 514 + 37 + 3 → RE

je + a + tu → jay + a + tu → jayatu (see 7.14)

b. In the same way, the root (bhū—to be) in forming 95

(bhavatu—let it be), undergoes a parallel series of a (sandhi) changes: VU + → I; + 37 4 (31 + 3) + 31; bhū + guna → bho; bho + a bh(a + u) + a; VH + 37 + → Hall

bhav + a + tu → bhavatu This process, with regard to the complex vowels 377 (0) and 377 (au) is similar to that in external Hau (sandhi). Thus, the sequence 371 + a (ubhau + eva—both of them): 341 + 3 + 09 → 341 + 2 + 0 3H10a ubhā + u + eva → ubhā + v + eva → ubhāv eva Final 31 (o), except as the result of another HL (sandhi) operation (3.35), is not common in word-final position. This process is obscured in external Hau (sandhi) by the im portant additional rule that: the ? (y) element of the complex vowel(e) is lost before a word-initial vowel other than short 31 (a) (3.20), and, in the case of (ai), before any vowel. So, in the sequence faut + 5(svarge + indraḥ—Indra is in heaven), the result would be: Faul 55: (svarga indraḥ). The process might be depicted as follows: Ft + 5-5: (9) (Fopf + 3) + 5-5: → svarge + indraḥ → (1) (svarga +i) + indraḥ → (2) Eqof + I + 55: → (3) 9 → 0(8) Foot Sos (2) svarga + y + indraḥ → (3) y → Ø (4) svarga indraḥ

3.17

3.18

Also, in the sequence 1 + 37GGR (tasmai + adadāt-He gave to him), the process could be seen as:

H + 3TGGICI → (9) ET + 3 + 3TGGIL tasmai + adadāt → (1) tasmā + i + adadāt → (?) 6 + 4 + 3TEGIE → (3) 4 → Ø (8) 6H 3TGETEI (2) tasmā + y + adadāt → (3) y → Ø (4) tasmā adadāt29

3.19

Note that when vowel hiatus (the sequence of two vowels) occurs as a result of a H (sandhi) rule or series of Hu (sandhi) rules, it is permitted to remain. In other words, in the case of vowels, only one pass through the fu (sandhi) rules is valid. One must not subject the resultant hiatus to further HAU (sandhi). In the case where a final (e) immediately precedes a short 31 (a), the 5 (e) remains unchanged while the 37 (a), frequently unstable in initial position (3.35), is lost.

3.20

Thus:

a +37604 → segar te + abruvan → te 'bruvan (They said.)

भारतदेशे + अवसत् → भारतदेशे ऽवसत् bhāratadeśe + avasat → bhāratadeśe 'vasat. (He lived in In dia.)

3.21

E (Pragshya) Vowels Certain vowels in certain restricted environments are not sub ject to the above rules. They are called Fje (pragshya) vowels and are as follows: a. vowels 5, $ (i, i), 3, 5 (u, ū), and (e), when they serve as

dual endings (4.12, 27) b. the 5, (i,i) of the pronoun 37- (ami) (See 19.1.b) c. the vowels of particles or interjections Examples: & + Start + 3111934 → od 3118a: dve + kanye + āgacchataḥ ► dve kanye āgacchatah. (Two girls come.) हे + आर्यपुत्र → हे आर्यपुत्र he + āryaputra → he āryaputra (O my lord)

3.22

Initial and Final Positions Since external Appu (sandhi) applies, by definition, at the junc

tures of words, it is useful to have a set of terms that describe sounds that occur at these junctures, namely at the beginning and end of words. a. The terminology for sounds occurring at the beginning of

words is quite simple. Such sounds are called initial sounds

or are said to be in initial position. b. The situation for sounds that occur at the end of words is,

however, a little more complicated. This is so because sounds in this final position are liable to various kinds of change depending upon whether another sound (i.e., an initial sound of a following word) follows them, and, if one does, upon the nature of that sound. i. Therefore, when we refer to a sound that occurs at the

end of a word, regardless of what may or may not fol low it, we say that the sound is a word final or in

word final position. ii. When we refer to a word final sound that has no other

sound following it in a sentence, as at the end of a sentence, or a single word cited by itself, we say that

the sound is in absolute final position. iii. In addition, we will also have occasion to refer to cer

tain sounds that almost always change when they occur in word final position. Obviously such sounds will usually be represented in final position by other sounds. We will call the original sounds (which are important despite the fact that they rarely occur in final position)

original finals. Possible Absolute Finals Despite the large number of sounds in Sanskrit, only a surpris ingly small number can occur in absolute final position. This is important because, especially with regard to consonants, ex ternal au (sandhi) operations are performed on word-finals with the absolute final as the point of origin.

3.23

3.25

Vowels in Absolute Final Position Any of the vowels, long or short, simple or complex, may oc cur in absolute final position. Consonants in Absolute Final Position a. Non-palatal stops

Of the stops (FYRİ-s (sparśa-s) of the opf-s (varga-s) other than the palatal (104-tālavya), only the first (non-voiced, non-aspirated) of each of (varga) is possible in absolute final position, i.e., (k), (4), 7 (t), and 9 (p). If others of the series (with either or both of the features of voicing and aspiration) occur as original finals, they are replaced by the first of the series.

Examples: 3194 → 3194; JEG → Tera anuştubh → anuştup; suhțd → suhst

b.

Palatal stops Palatals cannot appear in absolute final position; original final a → (c→ k), → < or 2 (→ or k).

Examples: 01 01:1795 1792; fac15 → Facic vāc → vāk; bhișaj → bhișak; virāj virāt

c. Original Final"-a "(-s)

The most common of the consonantal original finals, "-" (-s), becomes fahrt (visarga)""(-ḥ) in absolute final posi

tion (see 3.26). d. Nasals

"-4" (-m) and “-T" (-n) are extremely common in abso lute final position but are subject to a number of important changes (see 3.46).

Original Final "-" (-r) Original final "-" (-1) becomes ":" (-h) and behaves in some environments like final"-T (-s) (see 3.40). Original Final Consonant Clusters Original final consonant clusters are reduced to the first consonant of the cluster. Example: गच्छन्त् → गच्छन् gacchant →gacchan

3.26

3.27

HP (Sandhi) of Original Final“-H" (-s) By far the most confusing aspect of nonvocalic Afu (sandhi) and the one most essential to grasp quickly and thoroughly concerns the phonological permutations of original final“-! (-s), which may be replaced with the postvocalic aspiration called fant (visarga) "." (h) or with the semivowel "T" (r). The treatment of this sound in the various final positions is a little complex. However, it is especially important to learn, as “- (-s) is among the most common original final sounds in the language.

Treatment of final faart (visarga) is, like almost everything in Sanskrit grammar, systematic and elegant and should cause little difficulty if learned as such. Treatment of original final“- (-s) varies broadly according to whether or not the "-" (-s) follows an "37' (a) vowel or a non-“31” (a) vowel. The treatment of the final"-T (-s) in each of these cases then further depends upon the consonant or vowel that follows; whether or not that sound is voiced or voiceless, and in the case of a voiceless consonant, the ai (var ga) to which it belongs. "-8" (-s) Following Any Vowel but 37(a) or 311 (ā) a. Original final"#"(-s) becomes fahi (visarga) in abso

lute final position.

3.28

3.29

33

Example: 3 → 370:

agnis → agnih (fire)

b.

Final “-T' (-s) before any voiced initial (i.e., any vowel or any voiced consonant) becomes "T(r). Examples: 311H + 59 → ufura agnis + iva → agnir iva (like fire)

विष्णोस् + आयुधम् → विणोरायुधम्

vişņos + āyudham → vişnor āyudham (Vişnu's weapon.)

fara + alla A + 317) Jaafar gatis + nāsti (na + asti) → gatir nāsti (no way)

a + oita et hares + gaus → harer gauḥ (Hari's cow)

There is no exception to this rule, but if the following ini tial voiced sound happens to be an "7 (r), then to avoid the sequence "IT," there is a further change whereby the first “T' (r), the result of the change "T' (s) → "T" (r), is lost, and in compensation the preceding vowel, if short, is lengthened. Example: 31f + tad → 31 + → 31 m) + T → agnis + rocate → agnir + rocate → agni (0) + rocate →

अग्री रोचते । agnī rocate (Fire shines.)

c. Original final“T(-s) before non-voiced initials again var

ies according to two categories of following initial. The categories are: i Stops (E427-s—sparsa-s) of the three aul-s (varga-s)

homorganic with the three non-voiced sibilants

34

(350H7-5—ūşman-s). The sibilants are "T' (6), "T" (s), and “T'(s), and they correspond to the palatal (also tālavya), retrof

- mūrdhanya), and dental (Freddantya) classes. Non-voiced stops (Furf-s— sparsa-s) of these qu-s (varga-s), then, are the following six: “I (c); “7” (ch); “C” (t); “” (th);

"I" (t); "q" (th). ii. All other non-voiced consonants (including the sibi

lants themselves). In the first case, original final "-" (-s) becomes the sibilant corresponding to the auf (varga) of the following initial. Examples: ERE + E + ferai haris + calati → hariś calati. (Hari goes.)

3.30

विष्णोस् + छाया - विष्णोश्छाया

vişņos + chāyā — vişnoś chāyā (Vişnu's shadow)

Bra + atan arifa → Recai caifa i haris + tīkām karoti → hariş tīkām karoti. (Hari writes a com mentary.)

ifra + 1201: → 31fettfie: 1 agnis + tīkṣṇaḥ → agnis tikṣṇaḥ (no change) (Fire is fierce.)

a. Of these six stops (E4R-5—sparsa-s) only“ (ca), “Z!

(cha), and “I” (ta) are really common in word-initial posi tion. Therefore, the most frequently encountered changes are "" "T' (s →ś) and "A" "T" (s ) (no change). Still, if one is aware of the correspondences here, the

changes are easy to master. Original final "-" (-s) before all other non-voiced word-ini tial phonemes is changed to faret (visarga).

3.31

35

Examples: ERA + y4fa → Re: gerai haris + paśyati → hariḥ paśyati. (Hari sees.)

ERA + ata → ER: alai haris + khanati harih khanati. (Hari digs.)

3.32

Original Final "U" (s) after "31"' (a) Vowels The changes of final "T" (s) after “38' (a) and "3" (ā) are peculiar in several ways, and, since the morphological end ings"-37% (-as) and “-31T' (-ās) are of extremely common occurrence, it is important to learn the forms these endings take before the various kinds of word-initial phonemes. Original final “T(s) after “31”' (a) and “31” (ā) behaves in the same way as original final “T” (s) after other vowels in abso lute final position and before non-voiced initials. Examples: (146[+ 44f 74: fai rāmas + paśyati → rāmaḥ paśyati. (Rāma sees.)

3.33

2744 + Htai + gefa 274: Hai perai rāmas + sītām paśyati rāmahsītām paśyati. (Rāma sees Sītā.)

2744 + → 1990 rāmas + calati → rāmaś calati. (Rāma goes.)

3.34

3.35

Original final “-37'(-as) before voiced initials undergoes one of two transformations depending upon whether the initial is a. any voiced consonant or the vowel (short) "31"' (a), or b. any vowel other than (short) "31" (a). Before voiced consonants or a short “31” (a), original final "-37" (-as) changes to "-37" (-o), while a following initial short “31” (a) is, additionally, lost. Examples: 2742 + Jerufa → 27 Teuta i rāmas + gacchati → rāmo gacchati. (Rāma goes.)

36

24HH + IEL: Isl: paśyatas + rājñaḥ paśyato rājñaḥ

(While the king watches ...)

21441 + 3714 → TH 141 rāmas + ayam → rāmo 'yam. (He is Rāma.)

पश्यतस् + अर्जुनस्य → पश्यतो ऽर्जुनस्य paśyatas + arjunasya → paśyato 'rjunasya

(While Arjuna watches ...)

3.36

Before any vowel but short"31" (a), original final “-3772" (-as) becomes "31" (a), and the vowel hiatus remains unchanged. Examples: 2144 + 394 → 314 399 rāmas + uvāca → rāma uvāca (Rāma said.)

बुद्धस् + इव विद्यया → बुद्ध इव विद्यया buddhas + iva vidyayā → buddha iva vidyayā (like the

Buddha in wisdom)

3.37

3.38

One further restriction on the conditioning of original final "-3761" (-as) needs to be memorized. This is a restriction not only with regard to phonological environment but a restriction to two specific lexical items. Original final “-37T' (-as), when it ends either of the common nominative singular masculine pronouns ":" (sah) or "24:" (eşah)(see 5.5), becomes “31” (a) before any consonant, voiced or unvoiced. Examples: HCl + court → out: 1 sas + kļşņas → sa kṛṣṇaḥ. (He is Kļşņa.)

246 ++31f1 → 99 34 stari eşas + śukas + asti eșa śuko 'sti. (That is a parrot.)

37

3.39

The treatment of original final "317['(-ās) is quite simple: “317[' (-ās) becomes "3T' (-ā) before any voiced word-initial (vowel or consonant) without exception. Examples: हतास् वीरास् गच्छन्ति स्वर्गलोकम् → hatās vīrās gacchanti svargalokam →

हता वीरा गच्छन्ति स्वर्गलोकम् । hatā vīrā gacchanti svargalokam. (Slain heroes go to heaven.)

3.40

Original Final "-37" (car) In addition to the very common original final "-37' (-as), there occur, in only a very few words, instances of original final "-37' (-ar). Original final"-37' (ar) before non-voiced con sonants and in absolute final position behaves like final "-3761"(-as) (see 3.29.c). Before voiced sounds, except" (-r), it remains. Don't forget, Sanskrit does not allow the con sonantal sequence (rr) (3.29.b). a. There are a few instances in the language where

final"- (-1) is preceded by a vowel other than "31" (a). The rules for these are the same as those for

"-37' (-ar). b. Final"-37' (-ar) should not be confused with "-372/"

(-as) despite the fact that 1) original final “T' (s) (only after a non"39" (a) vowel) becomes “T" (r) before an initial voiced sound and 2) original final “-3R' (-ar) becomes"-37" (-aḥ), "-37" (-as), "-374"' (-as), or "-37" (-as), in the same environments as does origi

nal final"-375" (-as). REMEMBER: Before voiced initials, original finals"-37' ( as) and “3114' (-ās) never become“-37' (car) and"-37"' (-ār), while original final "-37" (ar) never becomes “-371"(-o). Original final “-3? (-ar) is virtually restricted to the two ad verbs 9 (punar—again), and ICT (prātar-in the morning).

38

Learn these words with the original final"-"(-1) so as to avoid confusion. Examples: EFR +977 +99:97: punar + punar → punaḥ punaḥ (again and again),

but JAR + GPRS + GU19A + fa → 99: gachtaire

punar +punar +dānavān +hanti → punaḥ punar dānavān hanti (Again and again he kills the demons.)

3.41

SO

प्रातर् + आगमिष्यति → प्रातरागमिष्यति prātar + āgamișyati → prātar āgamișyati (He will come in the morning.) General Principles of Consonant HP (Sandhi)

Just as the avoidance of vowel hiatus serves as a general prin ciple of vowel HPU (sandhi), so an overriding principle of much consonantal Hea (sandhi) is the avoidance, to a great extent, of the contact of markedly dissimilar consonants. Such contact, where it occurs, is often mitigated by the alteration of at least one feature of one or sometimes both of the juxtaposed sounds. Assimilation in External Hfa (Sandhi) of Final F427 (Sparśa) Sounds The alteration of one or more features of a sound to make it more like another sound is known as assimilation. When a sound assimilates to a following sound, the assimilation is said to be regressive. When a sound assimilates to a preceding sound, the assimilation is said to be progressive. External consonant Hmu (sandhi) generally involves assimilation with respect to the feature of voicing. The assimilation is generally regressive. In general, a non-voiced final Furf (sparsa) of any of (varga) becomes the voiced (non-aspirate) of the same aof (varga) before a voiced initial (EQR—svara or 49514—vyañjana). In general, such finals are unchanged before non-voiced initials.

3.4339

Examples: Solar + hafa + HE: → pengara HHTE: 1 krodhāt + bhavati + sammohaḥ → krodhād bhavati sammohaḥ. (Confusion comes from anger.)

31-TC + 371 → BRIGE: 1 āsit + asuraḥ → āsid asuraḥ. (There was a demon.) HHTEIA + faraya: → Hektarat: sammohāt + smộtivibhramah → sammohāt smộtivibhramah. (Loss of memory arises from confusion.)

3.44

A very important exception is that final "T" (-t), when it pre cedes an initial frí (sparśa) of the palatal class (alattālavya or“ -ca al-varga) or retroflex class ( mūrdhanya or “Z”?— ța cof-varga) becomes a de-aspirated FYRf (sparśa) of the same class as the initial and is voiced or non-voiced just as in 3.43. Examples: Ja + felcstela → afectatai tat + cikīrsati → tac cikīrsati. (He wants to do that.) dal + Stella Stella i tat + jahāti → tajjahāti. (He abandons that.)

3.45

An important corollary of this requires special attention. Final "T (-t), when it precedes initial “-T (-s), (the palatal sibi lant), becomes "" (c) and the following “T' () becomes "" (ch). Examples: F + cal + 974 +37499 + fra: → tat + śrutvā + kupitas + abhavat + śivah → तच्छ्रुत्वा कुपितो भवच्छिवः । tac chrutvā kupito 'bhavac chivah (Upon hearing that, Siva became enraged.)

40

3.46

External Afu (Sandhi) of Nasals Nasals, whether the first or second of a pair of juxtaposed con sonants, constitute exceptions to the above rule in that such consonant contacts generally entail more thorough assimila tion than in the case of non-nasal contacts. In external consonant contact involving a nasal, assimilation may affect not only the voicing of a test (sparśa) but also its mode and even the point of articulation (oral/nasal and qui—varga). Thus, any word-final stop before a word-initial nasal becomes the nasal of its proper aut (varga). Examples:

acl + H1 + ga → etat + mā + kuru —etan mā kuru. (Don't do that!)

3.47

3.48

9102 +424 → 915:44: vāk + mayaḥ → vāñmayah (consisting of speech) H (Sandhi) of Absolute Final Nasals Absolute final nasals are subject to a number of rules of vary ing importance for the beginner. By far the most important and most commonly invoked rule concerns absolute final"- " (-m), one of the most frequent finals in the language. Final "-" (-m) becomes 37Jfar (anusvāra) "" " (-m) before any following initial consonant (voiced or unvoiced). Examples: 1746 + 0.+ Tesla → TH Taula rāmas + vanam + gacchati → rāmo vanam gacchati. (Rāma goes to the forest.)

va

791414 + gt44 + gota → #fun gatos cota i sșīņām + pustakam + pațhati > ļķīņām pustakam pațhati. (He reads the sages' book.)

There are no exceptions to this rule.

3.50

3.51

Treatment of Absolute Final "-7" (-n) “-T' (-n), also a common final, is the subject of the following changes. Final “-I' (-n) before a non-voiced stop (E431-sparśa) of the three “sibilant" qui-s (vargas -s) (see 3.29.c) becomes 3769R (anusvāra) “'" (m). In addition, the sibilant homorganic with the following initial is inserted between the new final (m) and the initial. Examples: or + FL + TR + 374 + 27511 →

kasmin + cit + nagare + avasat + rājā →

कस्मिंश्चिन्नगरे ऽवसद्राजा । kasmimś cin nagare 'vasad rājā. (The king lived in a city.)

3.52

मूर्खान् + त्यजति + पण्डितः → मूल्स्त्य जति पण्डितः । mūrkhān + tyajati + panditaḥ → mūrkhāms tyajati panditaḥ. (A wise man leaves fools alone.) Final"-T (-n) before a voiced initial of the docu (tālavya) or TERE (mūrdhanya) apf-s (varga-s) becomes the nasal of the dof (varga) in question. Example: GA0G + Ref +576 → Hoeding: dānavān + jayati + indraḥ ► dānavāñ jayatīndraḥ. (Indra conquers the demons.)

3.53

Final “-T (-n) before initial “T' (s) becomes “ST (ñ), and the "T' (s) becomes "T" (ch) (cf. 3.45). Example: Ayer + 310419 + yunta YBEOGuilla i madhurān + sabdan + śmmoti madhurāñ chabdāñ chrmoti. (He hears sweet sounds.)

3.54

Final"-T' (-n) before initial" (1) becomes " "(m) (3174R anusvāra), and an additional "" (1) is inserted before the original one.

42

Example: 3746 + 9 + + : → uttamān + lokān + labhate + dharmajñaḥ →

उत्तमाँल्लोकाँल्लभते धर्मज्ञः । uttamāml lokāml labhate dharmajñaḥ. (A knower of dharma attains to excellent worlds.)

3.55

Final "E" (-ñ), "" (-n), and "T' (-n) are written as doubled when they occur after a short vowel and precede any initial vowel. Examples: स्तुवन् + आगच्छति → स्तुवन्नागच्छति । stuvan + āgacchati → stuvann āgacchati (He comes praising.)

6 + 50 → Battal hasan + iva → hasann iva (as though laughing)

3.56

Initial “7' (h) after a final Furf (sparśa) becomes the voiced aspirated 7431 (sparśa) of the auf (varga) of the preceding final. Example: CEL + <<fà + : → Geta EIR: 1 etat + harati + cauraḥ → etad (3.43) dharati caurah. (The thief carries that away.)

419 + P + caal aa aaa vāk + hi + devatā — vāgghi devatā. (For speech is a divinity.)

3.57

Internal Hau (Sandhi) Most of the above rules apply to external HIRU (sandhi) situa tions. Some, especially those concerning vowel Hau (sandhi) are applicable to internal HRU (sandhi) as well. In the case of consonantal afu (sandhi), however, the rules for external and

43

internal Afu (sandhi) often differ considerably. Internal HD (sandhi) rules are complex and, moreover, in order to be prop erly understood, depend upon knowledge of a great variety of different morphological units and processes. Therefore, it is better to leave discussion of most particular internal Hu (san dhi) rules for consonants to be dealt with as they arise in our survey of the various grammatical categories and forms of Sanskrit. Before proceeding to that survey, however, we may consider two simple but important and very common internal

PU (sandhi) changes. These are the changes of the Copy 3046 (dantya üşman) “H” (s) and nasal “T' (n) to the fa 3047 (mūrdhanya ūşman) "T" (s) and nasal “T (n), respectively. The dental 3,044 (üşman)“T' (s)—if not in word final position or followed by the 3R:R4 (antahstha) "*" (r)—is changed to "7" (s) if immediately preceded in a word by any vowel other than the "31' (a) vowels or by the consonants "a" (k) or "7" (r). Examples: Hista (sidati-he sits), but fasista (vișidati-he sinks down)

3.58

- (-su—locative plural ending): dung (kanyāsu—among maidens), but cag (deveșu—among gods) -P (-si—second person singular ending): 31PH (atsi—you eat),

(bhunakși—you eat)

A

-R1 (-sya-future tense marker): Gleita (dāsyati—he will give), but Han (bhavisyati—he will be)

3.59

If the Grey (dantya) nasal"?”(n) is preceded in a word by the ART 3,647 (mūrdhanya ūşman) "T" (), the 3R:24 (antaḥstha) "T" (r), or the vowels "F" (?) or "F" (), and if no doce (tālavya), 7(mūrdhanya), or Grey (dantya) consonant (ex cept the amou 3R:F99 (tālavya antaḥstha) "T' [y]) intervenes between the two, then the "7" (n) is changed to "UT' (n) if it is immediately followed by a vowel, semivowel, or nasal.

44

3.60

This alarmino This alarmingly conditional rule may seem to be a bit complex for such a seemingly minor change, and perhaps it is. Still, since the change is quite common, it is necessary to know the rule in order to spell many words correctly. For the moment, it will suffice to remember that “T' (n) when preceded by “T'(r), "T" (s), or “*” (r) is retroflexed in many environments and that the change, therefore, is a common one. Examples: 214 (rāma) + (ena-instrumental singular ending) → <140 (rāmeņa—by Rāma)

EF (brahman—the Absolute) + 371 (ā-instrumental singu lar ending) → FEM (brahmaņā—by the Absolute)

3.61

The operation of these two rules (3.59 and 3.60), in fact, ac counts for the great majority of the occurrences of the sounds "T" (s) and "UT' (n) in Sanskrit.

## 04 Parts of Speech and the Sanskrit Sentence

4.0

4.1

4.2

Conjugation of Verbs; Declension of Nouns and Pronouns Despite the fact that Sanskrit preserves many formal distinc tions no longer maintained in English, it expresses ideas in sentences that are in many ways quite close to English sen tences. A grammatical sentence in either language normally requires that certain categories be filled, either explicitly or implicitly. All the words of the Sanskrit language may be divided roughly into three basic types. These may, for the moment, be crudely designated as nominal (nouns and adjectives), verbal, and ad verbial. It is important at the outset to understand that the only unam biguous basis for this classification is formal rather than functional. In other words, despite grade school training, one should avoid regarding nouns as "things" and verbs as "ac tions." The distinctions that will concern us are as follows: a. A finite verb, fasa (tiñanta), is a word that varies in

accordance with person, number, tense, mode, and voice. b. A nominal item, OR (subanta), is a word that varies in

accordance with case, number, and gender. c. An adverbial item 3704146 (avyayapada) is a word that

never varies, (except, of course, when affected by a

(sandhi) rules). The Sanskrit Verb The Sanskrit verbal system comprises several conjugations. These permutations of several hundred, mostly monosyllabic, verbal roots (UTC-s dhātu-s) constitute perhaps the single most intimidating aspect of the language to the beginner. It must be

4.3

kept in mind, however, that many of the possible forms are of very rare occurrence and are retained only because of the con servative and artificial nature of the language. In this course we shall be concerned chiefly with a relatively small number of forms which will not absolutely defy your command. Re member, the first rule of learning Sanskrit is Don't Panic; everybody in the class is going through the same thing. Finite Verbs A finite verb is a verbal root, modified in accordance with the categories of person, number, tense, mode, and voice. Such modifications comprise the conjugation of a verb. A finite verb is the heart of a Sanskrit sentence. Without a finite verb, either expressed or implied, there can be no complete gram matical sentence or independent clause. On the other hand, a finite verb by itself may (with an implied or expressed subject) constitute a minimal sentence. Examples: 44114: 1

FRA paśyāmah (we see); hanyate (he, she, it is killed);

345511 tya jet (he, she, it should abandon);

छिन्दन्ति । chindanti (they cut);

करिष्यति । karișyati (he, she, it will do);

Hagi bhavatu (let it be);

4.6

T111

37 jagāma (he, she, it went); asmi (I am) Thus, the finite verb is the key word of any Sanskrit sentence or independent clause and must be discerned and understood in order to construe the sentence. This fact is basic to the un derstanding of any sentence, and we shall refer to it repeatedly when discussing the technique of reading a Sanskrit sentence.49

4.7

4.8

You will have noticed that in the above examples a single word seems to specify the act, the person, the number of actor(s), the time of action, the way or mode in which the speaker in tends the action (i.e., as a description, or prescription, or command, or wish, etc.), and even the distinction of passive/ active. All these categories are, in fact, specified in a given Sanskrit finite verb and are encoded in a given verbal form by the presence or absence of several series of subverbal units. These units are interrelated and may vary according to the other determinants in the same word. Person "Person” specifies the relationship among the actor(s) or subject(s) of a finite verb, the user(s) or speaker(s) of the clause or sentence of which the verb forms a part, and the audience, person, thing, or group to whom the sentence is addressed. The possible relationships are: a. First Person: The actor and the speaker are the same.

Example:

आगच्छामि। āgacchāmi (I'm coming.)

4.9

b. Second Person: The actor and audience are the same.

Example:

tat tvam asi.(You are that.)

c.

Third Person: The actor is neither the speaker nor the au dience. Examples: Tagal rāmo vadati. (Rāma speaks.)

देवा नन्दन्ति । devā nandanti. (The gods rejoice.)

50

4.10

On means

SO

4.11

Person, then, is used just as in English. First person means that “I” or “we” is the subject of the verb. Second person means that "you" (any number) is the subject of the verb. Third per son means that "he, she, it, or they” is the subject of the verb. Since we shall be using traditional Sanskrit grammatical ter minology, it is important to note here that, since verbs tend to be cited in their "third person” form (as opposed to the English practice of citing "infinitives"), the third person is called in Sanskrit 181944 (prathamapuruşa), which means literally "first person." Second person is called 4221444 (madhyama purusa), literally "middle person," and first person is called 3774434 (uttama puruṣa), literally "last person.” Thus, Sanskrit stu dents in India learn their verbal paradigms upside down" with respect to the way in which paradigms are leamed in European languages, insofar as the issue of person is concerned. Number This category specifies the number of subjects (or in some cases-see Lesson 9-objects) of a finite verb. Thus, we have in Sanskrit, as in English, a singular and a plural. In addition, Sanskrit has retained a third category, the dual, which is used with verbs having two subjects. The numbers with their San skrit names and function, are: Singular- Ce (ekavacana), speech for one, one subject. Dual- a (dvivacana), speech for two, two subjects. Plural—6699 (bahuvacana), speech for many, three or more subjects. Examples:

(ekavacana)—yn aala

śuko vadati. (The parrot speaks.)

4.12

द्विवचन (dvivacana)—शुकौ वदतः (sukau vadatah)

sukau vadataḥ. (The two parrots speak.)

afqan (bahuvacana)—2017 agha

sukā vadanti. (The parrots speak.)

4.13

Tense Generally, the "tense" of a Sanskrit verb indicates the time of the action or state expressed by the verb, relative to the time at which the verb is used. Basically, there are three such times, past (

a b hūtakāla), present (adhrahis-vartamānakala), and future Hour: bhavisyatkāla), although these do not actually correspond to the tense systems of Sanskrit. These systems will be studied individually. Examples: रामो वनं गच्छति । rāmo vanam gacchati. (Rāma goes to the forest.)

रामो वनमगच्छत् । rāmo vanam agacchat. (Rāma went to the forest.)

रामो वनं गमिष्यति । rāmo vanam gamisyati. (Rāma will go to the forest.)

वनं जगामेति वक्ष्यति । vanam jagāmeti vakşyati. (He will say, “I went to the forest.")

4.14

Mode

Distinctions of mode specify how a finite verb is to be used or how the actor or the subject is related to the action. Important examples are the indicative (description or narration), impera tive (injunction, command), and optative (exhoration, prescription). Examples: रामो वनं गच्छति । rāmo vanam gacchati. (Indicative: Rāma goes to the forest.)

हे राम, वनं गच्छ । he rāma, vanam gaccha! (Imperative: Rāma! Go to the forest.)

रामो वनं गच्छेत् । rāmo vanam gacchet. (Optative: Rāma should go to the forest.) (The modes will be learned individually as we proceed.)

4.15

4.16

Voice The distinction of voice is one of the most pervasive and ini tially puzzling aspects of the Sanskrit verbal system. Essentially, it is a binary distinction, encoded along with per son and number in the verbal paradigm. What is puzzling about it is not that it presents any special difficulties in memoriza tion. In fact, such difficulty is minimal, as the binary voice-pairs are usually closely similar. The problem is that, for the most part, voice has lost its semantic significance in Sanskrit, per sisting in the main as a purely formal, but nonetheless significant, distinction. In accordance with the distinction of voice, then a verb is clas sified as either R 4C (parasmaipada—word for another) or 37147146 (ātmanepada-word for one's self). These forms are frequently referred to in Western grammars as active and middle voice. However, the Sanskrit terms should be memorized im mediately to avoid confusion with the binary pair active/passive, a wholly different issue. 347446 (Ubhayapada) Verbs Many verbal roots (UTC-s dhātu-s) of classical Sanskrit are conjugated either in the आत्मनेपद (ātmanepada) or the परस्मैपद (parasmaipada). However, a large number may be conjugated, sometimes under certain conditions, in either 46 (pada). Such roots are sometimes called 342448 (ubhayapada—word for both). Still, to facilitate your mastery of the verbal paradigms, and to avoid confusion, in general verbal roots have been cited only in the 4G (pada) in which they most commonly appear and in which it is, therefore, most convenient to learn them. Thus, in the glossaries, verbal roots will be followed by the signs (Ā) or (P) to indicate either 31154746 (ātmane pada) or 2145 (parasmaipada). These, then, are the major categories involved in the conjuga tion of Sanskrit verbs. As will be clear from the fact that there

4.17

4.18

53

4.19

are three persons, three numbers, some five modes, four tense systems, and, throughout, two voices, a Sanskrit verb may po tentially have a very large number of forms. Of these, however, in the case of a given verb, many never occur or are only theo retical. Of those that do occur, many are rare and even deliberately obscure. Of the remainder, only a small portion are very common and need be mastered in the first year. ada mę (Vartamāne Lat): The Present Indicative The Sanskrit grammarians have, for the sake of precision and concision, designated each of the tenses of the language with its own little code word. All of these words consist of the letter " (1) followed by a vowel and a consonant. These little code words are often used in conjunction with other words which signify relative time, past (Tabhūta), presentaden vartamāna), or future (

Hot bhavisya). One of the most common and useful of the tenses is the present indicative, a tense used for simple description or narration of actions, states, or events occurring in the (relative) present or even the imme diate past and future. The grammarians call this tense CAA MC (vartamāne lat).

The endings for the CC

सीतालक्ष्मणावपि वनं गच्छतः । sītālakṣmaṇāv api vanam gacchataḥ. (Sītā and Lakşmaņa also go to the forest.)

सीते किं भाषसे । site! kim bhasase? (Sita, what are you saying?)

यत्र गच्छन्ति वीरास्तत्रापि गच्छाम्यहम् । yatra gacchanti vīrās tatrāpi gacchāmy aham. (Wherever the heroes go, I also go.)

साधु वयमपि गच्छामः । sādhu! vayam api gacchāmaḥ. (Very well. We too are going.)

Note that there are some characteristic clues to person, num ber, and voice. a. "-इ" (-i) is typical of the singular active (एकवचन

ekavacana, परस्मैपद-parasmaipada) and the third person plural (प्रथमपुरुष-prathamapurusa, बहुवचन–bahuvacana परस्मैपद-parasmaipada).

55

b. "-ए" (-e) is characteristic of all the आत्मनेपद (ātmanepada)

endings. c. "त्-" (t-) is characteristic of (प्रथमपुरुष-prathamapurusa,

एकवचन-ekavacana), the third person singular in both the

आत्मनेपद (ātmanepada) and परस्मैपद (parasmaipada).

Note that the उत्तमपुरुष एकवचन (uttamapurusa ekavacana first person singular) आत्मनेपद (atmanepada-middle)ending is simply “ए” (e), with no characteristic consonant. The very important singular voice contrast, then, is:

ति

आ ते

It is important that the following rules be learned now. a. When the vowel "-37-"(-a-) precedes any of the above end

ings which begin with either "H" (m) or "q" (v), it is lengthened. Examples: वदति

vadati (He speaks.) but agit

vadāmi (I speak.)

गच्छति

gacchati (He goes.) but tela:

gacchāvaḥ (We two go.)

b. When the vowel "-32" (-a-) (short) precedes either of the third

person plural endings (9214454 26997prathamapuruşa bahuvacana), it is lost. गच्छ + अन्ति → गच्छन्ति gaccha + antigacchanti (They go.)

N + 3 + HN bhāşa + ante → bhāşante (They speak.)

c. When“-39-" (-a-) precedes the first person singular middle

ending (3714459 Bohdetuttamapuruşa ekavacana), it is lost. Example: मन्य + ते → मन्यते

manya + te → manyate (He thinks.) but मन्य + ए → मन्ये

manya + e + manye (I think.)

d. After“-31-” (-a-) the initial "31' (ā) of the genye

(prathamapuruṣa) and 4€274479 receta (madhymapuruşa

57

dvivacana-second and third person dual) 31164146 (ātmanepada—middle) ending becomes “T' (e) and as in the previous rule (c) the "-31-” (-a-) is lost. Example: HRT + 3110 → HR manya + āte → manyete (Two people think.)

After any letter but“-31-" (-a-) the nasal “-7-" (-n-) of the genya, 469 , 31764-146 (prathamapurușa, bahuvacana, ātmane pada) is lost. Example: 903+37 yosta yuñj + ante yuñjate

but you +31 yosh

yuñj + anti → yuñjanti

4.23

The verbal root 37 (Vas—to be) One of the most common and useful of the Sanskrit verbal roots is 376 (as—to be). It is regularly used in the sense of "there is" or "there are" and is especially common as a copula to establish predication of the sort“A is (are) B," where A and B are any two nouns or a noun and an adjective. One peculiar ity of this verb is that, when it is used as a copula, it need not actually appear in the sentence and may be "understood.” Examples:

अस्त्यस्मिन्देशे नृपः । asty asmin deśe ngpah. (There is a king in this country.)

स्वर्गे सन्ति देवाः । svarge santi devāḥ. (The gods are in heaven.) रामो नृपः । rāmo nộpaḥ. (asti understood) (Rāma is king.)

ca: S1 kākāḥ kṛṣṇāḥ. (santi understood) (Crows are black.)

ART SCHI vānaro 'smi. (I am a monkey.) AGRI 5641 vānaro 'ham. (asmi understood) (I am a monkey.)

One slight problem that arises out of this frequent omission of the copula is that there may be some difficulty, on occasion, in distinguishing between a descriptive and a predicate adjective or between nouns that are in a predicate relationship and those that are in apposition. Thus, the phrase acut: 06-106: (krsnah kākaḥ) might mean “The crow is black," or "The black crow..." By the same token, the phrase Rret 24: (daśaratho nrpah) could mean “Dasaratha is king," or "King Dasaratha ..." In these and similar examples only the context can serve as a sure guide. It is clear, for example, in sentences like tout: la ga

hai (krṣṇaḥ kākaḥ vrkṣe vasati) “The black crow lives in the tree," and दशरथो नृपः सुखं जीवति । (dasaratho nrpah sukham jivati) “King Dasaratha lives happily," that the copula is not involved. Memorize immediately the 47 C (vartamāne lat) para digm of this important verb. 37 (as) (P)

Declension: The Sanskrit Noun Nominal forms together with the finite verbs make up the skel etal structure of the Sanskrit sentence. Just as verbs are conjugated, i.e., vary in accordance with person, number, tense, mode, and voice, so nominal items are "declined,” i.e., vary in accordance with gender, number, and case. 105 (Linga) Gender Gender is a thoroughgoing distinction throughout the declen sional system of Sanskrit. Sanskrit, like German, has three genders, masculine (for 5-pumlinga), feminine (Fils strilinga), and neuter (ngafox-napumsakalinga). The genders are "natural" insofar as animals and people are usu ally masculine or feminine according to their sex, but for the most part words simply belong to a given gender on a rather arbitrary basis and must simply be learned with their proper gender. Examples: 954: (purusah)

man adit (devi)

goddess भार्या

(bhāryā)

wife Opel (kanyā)

girl H (mitram)

friend Tel: (granthah) (m) book kry (pustakam) (n) book Adjectives have no inherent gender and take on the gender of the nouns they modify. den (Vacana) Number As with verbs (4.12), nouns are singular, dual, or plural, de pending upon whether one, two, or more than two of the persons, places, things, actions, etc., represented by the noun are indicated. 3151: (ajaḥ)-goat; 375 (a jau)—2 goats; 37511: (ajā))-goats Note: The category of number is the only one which is applicable to both nouns and verbs. Because of this, verbs and

4.27

60

their subjects (or objects (see Lesson 91) must always be in number agreement. Examples: पुरुषो गच्छति । puruṣo gacchati (The man goes.)

yout Tod: 1 puruṣau gacchataḥ (The two men go.)

) me

पुरुषा गच्छन्ति । puruşā gacchanti (The men go.)

4.28

4.29

ft (Vibhakti) Case

Cases are a series of formal modifications, marked by special terminations, that define precisely the function of a noun in a sentence, that is, the relation of that noun to a verb or to an other noun. The case endings thus serve much the same function that is served in English by word order and preposi tions. There are seven differentiated case functions in Sanskrit. This fact, although appalling at first, makes for a system that is much more lucid in its fine distinctions than are the declensions of many other Indo-European languages, which must define the same relations with a smaller number of cases. The seven cases fauft-s (vibhakti-s) are usually distinguished by the first seven ordinal numbers in Sanskrit and are, with their Sanskrit names, Westem names, some principal functions, and corresponding English prepositions:

1. g41 (prathamā—first) Nominative, naming, subject, or

direct object case. 2. Faili (dvitīyā—second) Accusative, direct object case. 3. gate (trtīyā—third) Instrumental, agentive, or subject case.

(with, by) 4. ageff (caturthi-fourth) Dative, indirect object case. (to,

for) 5. 40 (pañcami-fifth) Ablative, source case. (from)

61

6. 481 (sasthi—sixth) Genitive, possessive (partitive) case.

(of) 7. HHH (saptami-seventh) Locative, location case. (in, on) Examples: (numbers following words indicate case) दशरथस्य वचनं श्रुत्वा नगरानिःसृत्य daśarathasya (6) vacanam (2) śrutvā, nagarān (5) nihsstya,

लक्ष्मणेन सहेहागत्य धर्माय वने वसति रामः । lakṣmaṇena (3) sahehāgatya, dharmāya (4) vane (7) vasati

rāmaḥ(1).

Having heard Dasaratha's (6) speech (2), having come out from the city (5), and having come here with Lakşmaņa (3), Rāma (1) lives in the forest (7) for the sake of righteousness (4).

4.30

To this list is often added an eighth item which is not a true case. This is the vocative, or HTF (sambodhana), the form of direct address. Example: हरे कृष्ण हरे कृष्ण कृष्ण कृष्ण हरे हरे । hare krsna, hare krşņa, kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa, hare hare

O Hari! O Krşņa, etc.

4.31

4.32

Sanskrit nouns fall into several declensions depending upon their phonological structure (predeclension stem final) and in herent gender. The Citation of Nouns Although it is common practice in the West to cite Sanskrit nouns in their stem forms (i.e., predeclensional forms), we shall depart from this practice to a certain extent. For "-37-" (-a-) stems particularly, it is advisable to learn the nouns in their nominative singular form. In this way, the gender of each item can be learned along with the word itself. These nominative forms should then be cited in absolute final position. For example, cite 96 (puruşa) as 984: (puruṣaḥ) (nom. sing. masc.)

62

"man"; and cite पुस्तक (pustaka) as पुस्तकम् (pustakam) (nom. sing. neut.)"book.” Nouns ending in other vowels, particularly "ऋ" (r) and in consonants should be learned both in stem-form and nominative singular. Examples: stem

nom. पितृ (pitr) (m) पिता (pitā)

father राजन् (rājan) (m) राजा (rājā) ब्रह्मन् (brahman) (n,m) ब्रह्म (brahma) (n) brahman

ब्रह्मा (brahmā) (m) Brahma

king

The declensions of the masculine and neuter stems differ only in the first and second cases. This is true of almost all sets of masculine and neuter nouns with the same stem final.

The संबोधन (sambodhana), or vocative, form differs from the nominative only in the singular. This is true of all nouns re gardless of stem final or gender. Memorization of paradigms

This is perhaps the least stimulating aspect of language learning. Unfortunately, however, it is necessary to memorize at least the major paradigms in order to avoid constant reference to grammar books. Paradigms should be learned in the traditional

Thus, the declension of 954: (puruṣaḥ) should be recited as 454: (puruṣaḥ)/4-47 (puruṣau)/441: (puruşāḥ); 444(puruşam)/ get (puruṣau) / Go (puruşān); etc. In the same way, the conjugation of verbs is learned person by person "across" the number. Thus, the conjugation of aara (vadati) should be recited as: वदति (vadati)/ वदतः (vadatah)/ वदन्ति (vadanti); वदसि (vadasi)/ वदथः (vadathah)/ वदथ (vadatha); etc. Parts of Speech, the 146 (kriyāpada) and the dres (kartr) a. As mentioned above (4.6) a finite verbal form may be con

sidered to be the heart of and indeed, the minimal requirement for a grammatical Sanskrit sentence. Consid ered as an element of a sentence, such a verbal form may be called the foll4C (kriyāpada-action word) in that it is expressive of the action or state that is indicated by a given verbal 91 (dhātu) or root. There is normally only one finite verb in a clause. The next most important word, or group of words in a sentence is the stoel (karty), the agent or subject. The does (karty) denotes the person, thing, place, or even abstract concept that carries out the action or experiences the state or condition expressed by the I (dhātu). All grammatical sentences must have a finite verb (or some equivalent form) and a nominal subject whether or not the words for those items actually appear in the sentence. Thus, in the sentence रामः पश्यति (rāmah pasyati-Rama sees), the word पश्यति (paśyati—sees), which is the 924464 (prathamapuruṣa) एकवचन (ekavacana) परस्मैपद (parasmaipada) वर्तमाने लट् (vartamāne lat) of the root 47 (pas), is clearly the 146 (kriyāpada). The ending"-fa” (-ti) here specifies the number of the subject. If we ask now "Who sees?" we must answer "Rāma.” “Rāma" then is the ones (karts) or the subject; the one who does the seeing. It is important to note here, for later reference, that the subject to (karty) of a Sanskrit sentence is always the agent of the action,

65

4.38

regardless of whether the sentence is "active" or "passive." Thus, although we might say that "dog" is the subject of the English sentence, “The dog bites the man," but that "man" is the subject of the sentence, “The man is bitten by the dog," Sanskrit grammarians would not hesitate for a moment in saying that “dog," the biter, is the fact (karty) of

both. Parts of Speech Continued: *** (sakarmaka) and 377443 (akarmaka) UTC-s (dhātu-s) and the cost (karman). The verbal UTC-s (dhātu-s) must be distinguished according to whether or not they express an action that may have, in addi tion to the necessary toes (karte) an immediate and direct recipient of its force. This distinction corresponds to the one we know that separates transitive from intransitive verbs. The immediate recipient of the force of an action is called the (karman) or direct object. Transitive roots are said to be H44 DU-s (sakarmakadhātu-s-roots with a direct object) while intransitive roots are called 37047U-s (akarmakadhātu s-roots without a direct object). In general, it is correct to say that a Sanskrit root is Hap (sakarmaka) when its English equivalent is transitive. The equivalence holds for 314 (akarmaka) or intransitive roots. One should note here, how ever, a peculiarity concerning the treatment in Sanskrit of verbs of motion (see 4.41). Despite the fact that such verbs are re garded, like their English equivalents, as intransitive, it is the usual practice in Sanskrit to place the goals of motion in the cases appropriate to the genuine direct objects. Thus, in the sentence <741 upea i (rāmo nrpam paśyati-Rāma sees the king), 24: (nrpaḥ), the one who is seen, is thereby the (karman) or the direct object of the verbal ut (dhātu) 421 (pas). This too, would be so whether the sentence were active or pas sive. In addition, in the sentence 741 A Taula 1 (rāmo vanam gacchati-Rāma goes to the forest), 1 (vanam), the goal of Rāma's going, is treated like a direct object.

The Cases and Their Functions It is by no means accurate to say that each case has one and only one function. Some of the cases may have several func tions in different contexts while one function may be served by more than one case. Moreover, even so cultivated a lan guage as Sanskrit shows numerous examples of what may be called “loose construction," whereby a case may be forced to serve a function other than its own. This is especially true in the language of the epics. On the other hand, it is true that each case generally does have, if not one, then a fairly restricted range of uses. It is these significant uses that must be leamed now. gena (Prathamā Vibhakti): The Nominative Case The qe fa (prathamā vibhakti) has a variety of func tions, all of which may be subsumed under the heading of "naming." It is unique among the cases in that it is used to name or specify parts of speech whose form has already been determined by the form of a finite verb. Thus when a nominal item in a sentence appears in the Tea Pa (prathamā vibhakti), it must be in number agreement with a finite verb whether that verb actually occurs in the sentence or is “under stood." The full application of this mysterious statement will not be clear until you have studied the contents of Lesson 9. Until then, however, it will suffice to say that, in general, the 9441fa (prathamā vibhakti), is used to denote the subject of a finite verb in a clause or sentence. It may also be used as the citation case for a noun. Examples: नृपो वदति । nrpo vadati. (The king speaks.)

ब्राह्मणौ नृपं पश्यतः । brāhmņau npam paśyataḥ. (The two brāhmans see the king.)

67

तत्र पुस्तकानि न सन्ति । tatra pustakāni na santi. (There are no books there.)

4.41

Gripen af (Dvitīyā Vibhakti): The Accusative Case The facilit fat (dvitiyā vibhakti) or accusative case is pre dominantly the case that marks the direct object of a transitive verb or the goal of a verb of motion. Examples: पुरुषो मृगं हन्ति । puruṣo mrgam hanti. (The man kills the deer.)

ब्राह्मणाः पुस्तकानि पश्यन्ति । brāhmaṇāḥ pustakāni paśyanti. (The brāhmans see the books.)

रामो वनं गच्छति । rāmo vanam gacchati. (Rāma goes to the forest.) (See 4.38.)

It may also be used with words meaning units of time to indi cate duration. Example: रामः संवत्सरं वने वसति । rāmaḥ samvatsaram vane vasati. (Rāma lives in the forest for a year.)

The accusative singular of many nouns may be used adverbially. The resulting forms are, of course, 3144146-s (avyayapada-s indeclinables). Examples: अस्ति नृपो दशरथो नाम । asti nļpo daśaratho nāma. (There is a king by name Dasaratha.)

दशरथः सुखं जीवति । daśarathaḥ sukham jīvati. (Dasaratha lives happily.)

68

al (Trtiyā Vibhakti): The Instrumental Case The gaten fant (trtīyā vibhakti) or instrumental case, serves several functions. a. It is the case of agency or accompaniment.

Example:

शरेण हन्ति बालकम् । śarena hanti bālakam. (He kills the boy with an arrow.) When accompaniment is meant, the instrumental is fre quently followed by one of three 3Top (avyaya) words: HE (saha), 444 (samam), or H1974 (sākam). Example: दशरथेन सह संवदति ब्राह्मणः । daśarathena saha samvadati brāhmaṇaḥ. (The brāhman converses with Dasaratha.)

b. The air fat is the agent or subject case in so-called

"passive," or 0 PITT (karmaṇi prayoga) constructions,

(Lesson 9) c. The gaten aufs (trtiyā vibhakti) has a number of impor

tant idiomatic usages, among which you should learn the following:

1. With the 3Top (avyaya) word faal (vinā) the sailen

fauft (trtiyā vibhakti) (like the accusative and sometimes the ablative) is used to indicate the ab sence of something in the sense of "without," or "excluding." Example: बालकेन विना वनं गच्छति ब्राह्मणः । bālakena vină vanam gacchati brāhmaṇaḥ. (The brāhman goes to the forest without the boy.)

With the invariable word 374 (alam-enough, sufficient), the instrumental is used in the sense of "enough of..!"Example: अलमनेन वचनेन । alam anena vacanena! (Enough of this talk!)

3. With the interrogative pronoun 4 (kim), the salen

fat is used in the sense of “what of (it)," signi fying lack of interest or belief in the relevance or use of something. Example: किमनेन पुस्तकेन ।

kim anena pustakena? (What's the use of this book?)

4.43

481 faut (Şasthi Vibhakti): The Genitive Case The 487 ft (sașthi vibhakti) or genitive, is the possessive case, and unlike the other cases, it generally relates one noun to another. Examples: ब्राह्मणस्य पुत्रः । brāhmaṇasya putraḥ (the son of the brāhman)

ब्राह्मणस्य पुत्रस्य मित्रम् । brāhmaṇasya putrasya mitram (the friend of the son of the brāhman)

It is very commonly used with a verb "to be" to indicate pos session, as Sanskrit has no verb really equivalent to English "to have.” In this important construction the possessor is put in the genitive while the thing possessed in the nominative is the subject of the copula. Examples: ब्राह्मणस्य पुत्रो नास्ति । brāhmaṇasya putro nāsti. (The brāhman has no son.)

दशरथस्य द्वे पुस्तके (स्तः)। daśarathasya dve pustake (staḥ). (Dasaratha has two books.)

4.44

Word Order Since the case endings of Sanskrit so precisely specify the relationships of all the parts of speech, there is no need for the rigidly restricted word order associated with English. For example the sentence <TH Yielà 1 (rāmo mrgam paśyati Rāma sees the deer) will be perfectly clear, regardless of the sequence of the words. Thus, Ti qefa 214: 1 nefat <TH (mrgam paśyati rāmaḥ; paśyati rāmo mrgam); both mean exactly the same thing. This is clearly not the case with the English translation. Because of this, word order is relatively free in Sanskrit, and in some cases, because of the requirements of metrical composition, words of a complex sentence may occur in fairly jumbled order with, for example, a noun and its modifier at opposite ends of the sentence. However, there is a general order of words in Sanskrit prose to which we should closely adhere when composing sentences, unless there is an overriding reason to ignore it. The order is basically subject object-verb. Other parts of speech are inserted within this framework, and all modifiers of a given noun should be contiguous. For example: राक्षसानां नृपो दशरथस्य पुत्र रामं सरोषं पश्यति । rākṣasānām nypo (subj.) daśarathasya putram rāmam (obj.) saroșam paśyati (adverb-verb). (The king of the rākṣasas views Dasaratha's son Rāma with anger.) One regular departure from this order is that narratives, or sto ries, often begin with a form of the verb 376 (as—to be). Example:

अस्ति नृपो दशरथो नाम । asti nrpo daśaratho nāma. (There is a king named Dasaratha.)

Personal Pronouns Sanskrit has a large and varied system of personal and demon strativepronouns (सर्वनाम-s-sarvanāman-s),and it is convenient to learn this system as quickly as possible.

वयं न जानीमः । vayam na jānīmaḥ. (We don't know.)

Note: These forms are declined pronouns and not adjectives. Therefore, there is no issue of agreement between them and the things they appear to modify. Keep this in mind especially with regard to the 981 (şaşthi) or the genitive case. Examples: 44 45:(mama putrah)(m) my son 44 HRT (mama bhārya) (f) my wife 44 9 (mama pustakam) (n) my book

Ayla (Nipāta). Particles a. The particle 7 (sma), when it appears after a m (lat

present indicative) form, makes of the form a simple past tense. Examples: sofa i gacchati. (He goes.)

TUR I gacchati sma.(He went.) b. The particle sta (iti) is one of the most important and useful

of the Sanskrit particles. It functions frequently as a quo tation mark immediately after the speech, thought, or idea quoted. Since Sanskrit rarely uses indirect quotation, the use of stà (iti) is extremely common. Thus, 14 serta

GRI (nrpo 'ham iti vadati), "He says he is the king" or literally, “He says, “I am the king'.” ştà (iti), then, has the function of setting off independent sentences within sen tences. Thus, in the above example there are two sentences;

14 64 (nrpo 'ham-I am the king); and aata (vadati he says). Unless the std (iti) is understood, the two will be confused and difficult to separate. If you find an sla (iti) in a sentence, then, use it as a convenient point to break the sentence down into smaller, more manageable units.

Note that although the paradigm differs considerably from the ones already learned, particularly in the singular, several end ings remain the same. Note especially the ageft (caturthi) and 981 (sasthi) 6 (bahu"), the 981 (sasthi) and H4 (saptami) द्वि (dvii), and the तृतीया (artiya), चतुर्थी (caturthi) and पञ्चमी (pañcami) f (dvi). These endings— -31(-ām), -37: (-oh), -17: (-bhyah), - 2114 (-bhyām)—are the same for all stems of all genders in the language. ageft fat (Caturthi Vibhakti): The Dative Case a. The fourth, or so-called dative case, is the case of the indi

rect object. It expresses the relations covered in English by the prepositions "to" and "for." It is also regularly used in the sense of “for the purpose of." Examples: द्विजो भार्यायै सर्वं ददाति, वनं च गच्छति । dvijo bhāryāyai sarvam dadāti, vanam ca gacchati. (The brāhman gives everything to his wife and goes to the forest.)

युद्धायागच्छामीति भणति वीरः । yuddhāyāgacchāmīti bhanati vīraḥ. (The hero says, “I come for battle.")

b. It is regularly used with objects of “reverence” 744 (namas).

Example: Il 3 HR1 74: 11 om rāmāya namaḥ (“OM” Reverence to Rāma)

5.3

Taifa (Pañcami Vibhakti): The Ablative Case a. The fifth case, or ablative, is the case of origin, or source.

Example: सङ्गात्संजायते कामः कामात्क्रोधो ऽभिजायते । sangāt samjāyate kāmaḥ kāmāt krodho 'bhijāyate. (Desire arises from attachment, and anger springs from desire.)

नगराद्वनं गच्छति कुमारः । nagarād vanam gacchati kumāraḥ. (The boy goes to the forest from the city.)

b. The is used for objects of fear.

Example: राक्षसान्न बिभेति रामः । rākṣasān na bibheti rāmaḥ. (Rāma does not fear the demon.)

c. This case may, like the facili (dvitiyā) and Tairi (trtiyā),

be used before the invariable word faal (vinā) in the sense of “without." Example: रामाद्विना क्वायोध्या । rāmād vinā kvāyodhyā? (Where is Ayodhyā without Rāma?)

5.4

HGH FH (Saptami Vibhakti): The Locative Case a. The seventh, or locative case, expresses location (in, on,

etc.). Examples: ga qafa fast: 1 vrkṣe vasati dvijah. (The bird lives in the tree.)

अयोध्यायां वसति दशरथः । ayodhyāyām vasati daśarathah. (Daśaratha lives in Ayodhyā.)

देवेष्वपि रामस्य तुल्यो नास्ति । deveșv api rāmasya tulyo nāsti. (Rāma has no equal, even among the gods.)

82

b.

The locative is also used to indicate reference to something. Example: ब्राह्मणस्य हनने प्रायश्चित्तं नास्ति । brāhmaṇasya hanane prāyaścittam nāsti. (With respect to

the murder of a brāhman, there is no expiation.)

c.

It is also used idiomatically for the object of love, attachment, or devotion. Examples: राधायां स्निह्यति श्रीकृष्णः । rādhāyām snihyati śrikțşnah. (Krsna loves Rādhā.)

धर्मे रतो नृपः । dharme rato nặpaḥ. (The king is devoted to dharma.)

कामेषु सङ्गात्क्रोध उपजायते । kāmeșu sañgāt krodha upajāyate. (Anger arises out of attachment to objects of desire.)

5.5

HD-147 (Sarvanāman): Demonstrative Pronouns Sanskrit has several pronouns that may correspond as third person 94 954 (prathama purusa) to the two personal pro nouns given in Lesson 4. These pronouns, however, distin guish gender and frequently serve as demonstrative pronouns or even as definite articles. Examples: तं बालकं पश्यति स नृपः । tam bālakam paśyati sa nspaḥ. (The (that) king sees that (the) boy.)

तस्मिन्वने वसति सः। tasmin vane vasati sah. (He lives in that forest.)

One of the most common of these pronouns is that," cited in its neuter nominative singular form as cl (tat). The paradigm is as follows:

Note that in several cases, these forms correspond closely to the equivalent forms of -31 (-a) and -371 (-ā) stem nouns. This is especially so in the singular of the तृतीया (trtiya) and षष्ठी (sasthi) विभक्ति-s (vibhakti-s) and for the पुंलिङ्ग (pumlinga), नपुंसकलिङ्ग (napumsakalinga) तृतीया बहुवचन (urtiya bahuvacana). These forms are typical of the pronominal declension, and their correspondence indicates that the -31 (-a) and 31 (-ā) declen sions, although statistically overwhelming, are, in fact, irregu

85

lar among the nouns in that they show, in the cases cited, the typically pronominal endings (e.g.,- (-ena), -3764 (-asya), - (-aih), etc.). The neuter aa (tat) is of particular impor tance as an abstract impersonal pronoun, used much as we use "that" or "it" in English. Examples: तत्समीचीनं भवति । tat samicīnam bhavati. (That's okay.)

नृपो तस्य ब्राह्मणस्य पुत्रं हन्ति । nļpo tasya brāhmaṇasya putram hanti. (The king kills the brāhman's son.)

तेन ब्राह्मणो दुःखमनुभवति । tena brāhmaṇo duḥkham anubhavati. (Because of that (liter ally, "by that'], the brāhman experiences grief.)

Memorize: It is a good idea to memorize the instrumental

(tena) and especially the ablative dela (tasmāt), which are commonly used in the sense of "therefore." Example: रामो नगरं त्यजति । तस्माज्जना दुःखिता भवन्ति । rāmo nagaram tyajati. tasmāj janā duḥkhitā bhavanti. (Rāma leaves the city. Therefore, the people become sorrowful.)

5.6

A closely related pronominal stem Catel (etat) has, with the prefix (e), the same paradigm as Tal (tat). Thus its geht apo (prathamā eka) forms are: 44: (eşaḥ—m, see 3.58), da (etat—n), and 41 (eșā—f). For other important pronominal, stems see 19.0-2.

5.7

Adjectives of Pronominal Declension Quite aside from the partial similarity between the -31 (-a) stem nominal items (nouns and adjectives) and that of the demon strative pronoun, there is a small but fairly important group of

86

-31 (-a) stem adjectives whose declension is virtually identical with that of this pronoun. Five of the more common of these adjectives are:

अन्य (anya) other एक (eka) one (in 28997-several) पर (para) other, next, higher

(pūrva) previous, former (sarva) each, every, all

Examples: एकस्मिन्देश एको नृपः । ekasmin deśa eko nệpah. (In one country there is (only) one king.)

ब्राह्मणस्य सर्वे पुत्रा हताः । brāhmaṇasya sarve putrā hatāḥ. (All the sons of the brāhman are killed.)

पूर्वस्मिन्संवत्सरे वीरा वनं गच्छन्ति स्म । pūrvasmin samvatsare vīrā vanam gacchanti sma. (Last year the heroes went to the forest.)

सर्वेषां पुरुषाणां राम उत्तमः । sarvesām puruşāņām rāma uttamah. (Rāma is the best of all men.)

अन्यत्पुस्तकं तव नाहं पश्यामि । anyat pustakam tava nāham paśyāmi. (I don't see your other book.)

5.8

The paradigms of these adjectives are exactly like that of demonstrative pronouns in all three genders except that of all of them only 31 (anya) shows the ending - (-t) in the 9841 (prathama) and द्वितीया (dvitiya), एक° (eka°), of the नपुंसक° (napumsaka").

87

Example: नृपः सर्वं ब्राह्मणेभ्यो ददाति स्म । तेन तस्यान्यत्किमपि न भवति । nộpaḥ sarvam brāhmaṇebhyo dadāti sma. tena tasyānyat kim api na bhavati.

(The king gave everything to the brāhmans. Therefore he has nothing else.)

EXERCISES

Translate the reading into English. Write out and learn the paradigms in all three genders for a (pūrva), and in 1985 (napumsaka") for 3 R4 (anya). Translate the following sentences. 1. Therefore, the king loves all his sons. (See 5.4) 2. In Ayodhyā, all sons of the king are handsome. 3. The angry brāhman does not hear the words of the king's

wife. 4. All righteous kings rule for the sake of their subjects. 5. Kings do not perform sacrifices without brāhmans. (See

4.42.b.) 6. Because of those (two) sacrifices, the kingdom is peaceful. 7. King Dasaratha loved especially his eldest offspring. (Use

-sma.) 8. But, in the course of time, the two wives forget the sacrifice. 9. With those wives, the heroes dwell in Ayodhyā. 10. Rāma goes to the forest for the sake of righteous people. 11. The hero hears the words of his wife and becomes angry. 12. Joyfully the girl thinks, “I am listening to the adventures

of Rāma."

Memorize the following verse

रामो राजमणिः सदा विजयते रामं रमेशं भजे

रामेणाभिहता निशाचरचमू रामाय तस्मै नमः । रामानास्ति परायणं परतरं रामस्य दासो ऽस्म्यहं

रामे चित्तलयः सदा भवतु मे भो राम मामुद्धर ॥

Rāma, jewel among kings, is always victorious.

I worship Rāma, Ramā's (Sītā's) lord. By Rāma the hosts of night-stalkers are destroyed.

Homage to Rāma. There is no higher recourse than Rāma.

I am a servant of Rāma. Let the focus of my thoughts always be on Rāma.

O Rāma, save me!

Note: The पुंलिङ्ग (pumlinga) and स्त्रीलिङ्ग (strilinga) paradigms differ of necessity only in the instrumental singular and the accusative plural, while the feminine has alternate endings for cases 4,5,6, and 7, one of which is the same as the masculine -इ(-i) stem and the other of which is the same as the feminine - 31 (-ā) stem (see 5.1). Since the stem forms and the nomina tive singular forms are the same for both the gis (pumlinga) and FC (strilinga) forms, it is important to memorize the correct genders of such words as they are learned. There is a general, but by no means invariable, rule that words that end in-ति (-ti),-धि (-dhi) and-टि (-ti) are usually स्त्रीलिङ्ग (strilinga).

6.2

a. The -3 (-1) and the - 3 (-u) stems are exceptions to the general

rule that go (pumlinga) and This (napumsaka) nouns in the same stem final are identical except in the gem

(prathamā) and frien (dvitīyā) faut-s (vibhakti-s). b. Note that in these declensions - 5 (-i) and the -3 (-u) are

treated analogously, each remaining unchanged, being "guņated" (see 3.6-7), lengthened, or changed to the cor responding semivowel in the same cases. नपुंसक (napumsaka) -इ (-i) stems and स्त्रीलिङ्ग (strilinga)-3 (-u) stems (not illustrated here) are similarly analogous to नपुंसक (napumsaka)-3 (-u) and स्त्रीलिङ्ग (strilinga) -इ (-1) stems, respectively. Thus the films (strilinga) noun 277 (dhenu), "cow,” declines similarly to fa: (gatiḥ): : (dhenuh), (dhenü), Etha: (dhenavah), etc. The holes (napumsakalinga) noun aif (vāri), “water,” declines similarly to मधु (madhu): वारि (vari), वारिणी (varini), वारीणि (vārīņi), etc. Keep in mind that the HTH 105° (saptami eka") of the gless (pumlinga) (optionally Fils (strilinga]) stems in both -$ (-1) and -3 (-u) is -37 (-au). This often causes further confusion among already confused Sanskrit stu dents, especially since this ending is the one which marks the 4471 (prathamā) and f&citii facea (dvitiyā dvivacana) of many stems.

Examples: -5 (-i);

अग्नौ प्रक्षिपति घृतम् । agnau praksipati ghstam. (He throws the ghee in the fire.)

-3 (-u);

शत्रावपि स्निह्यति साधुः । śatrāv api snihyati sādhuḥ. (A good man loves even his enemy.)

e. In addition to the nouns that end in 5 (i) and 3 (u), there are

a number of adjectives that have their stems in 5 (i) and 3 (u). These of course must agree in gender, number and case with the noun they modify. Example: बहवः शिष्याः पुस्तकं पठन्ति । bahavaḥ śişyāḥ pustakam pathanti. (Many students read the book.)

6.3

Interrogative, relative, and correlative: The 2-4-(k-y-t) series As in English, a Sanskrit sentence may be either declarative or interrogative, while a clause of a sentence may be subor dinate or independent. a. Interrogative sentences

A sentence may be marked as interrogative in a number of ways. i. One way is by giving a declarative sentence a rising

inflection at its end similar to the inflection used for this purpose in English. This, however, cannot be rep resented in the written language. Another simple way to turn a declarative sentence into an interrogative is to make the अव्ययपद (avyayapada-indeclinable) अपि (api) the first word of the sentence. Here again a ris ing inflection is usually employed in speech. These two techniques serve to form general questions with

regard to an entire statement. Such questions can be answered either "yes" or "no." Examples: declarative: रामः सीतया सह वनं गच्छति । rāmaḥ sītayā saha vanam gacchati. (Rāma goes to the forest with Sītā.)

interrogative:

अपि रामः सीतया सह वनं गच्छति । api rāmaḥ sītayā saha vanam gacchati? (Does Rāma go to the forest with Sītā?)

ii. Another very important kind of interrogative sentence

is that in which a particular part of speech is replaced by an appropriate interrogative element. This kind of question calls for a specific answer. Examples: declarative: 274: H I HE Q Tourai rāmaḥ sītayā saha vanam gacchati. (Rāma goes to the forest with Sītā.)

interrogatives: co: HARI HE QE Toula i kaḥ sītayā saha vanam gacchati? (Who goes to the forest with Sītā?) रामः किं करोति । rāmaḥ kim karoti? (What does Rāma do?)

रामः कया सहा वनं गच्छति । rāmaḥ kayā saha vanam gacchati? (With whom does Rāma go to the forest?)

(14: $ quia i rāmaḥ kutra vasati? (Where does Rāma live?)

97

कस्त्वं कस्मादागच्छसि । kas tvam? kasmādāgacchasi. (Who are you? Where do you come from?)

All of these "question words," whether pronouns, ad

jectives, or adverbs, begin with the sound of (k). b. Subordinate Clauses

As in English, a Sanskrit clause may be either indepen dent, i.e., able to stand alone as a sentence, or subordinate, i.e., unable to stand alone. Subordinate clauses may be participial or relative. The former will be considered in connection with the various participles. The latter corre spond to English relative clauses such as:

"all who wish to leave ..." "where the sun never shines ..."

"the girl with whom you were speaking ..." Clauses of this kind in Sanskrit always include a relative marker. These are pronouns, adjectives, or adverbs corre sponding closely to the interrogative markers. These words, however, always begin with the sound (y). This distinc tion is in contrast to English where the same words are generally used both in interrogative and relative senses. Examples:

यः सीतया सह वनं गच्छति yah sītayā saha vanam gacchati... ([the man) who goes to the forest with Sītā ...)

यया सह रामो वनं गच्छति yayā saha rāmo vanam gacchati... ([the woman) with whom Rāma goes to the forest ...)

यत्र वसति रामः yatra vasati rāmaḥ... (where Rāma lives...)

Correlative Clauses Correlative clauses are independent clauses that "complete" relative clauses to form complex sentences. They are like

98

the English clauses: "All who wish to leave may go," "/ couldn't live where the sun never shines," "The girl with whom you were speaking is my sister." Notice that in the English examples only the relative clause contains a marker (in these cases a pronoun). Sanskrit usage differs from that of English in that it generally requires that the correla tive clause, too, contain a corresponding marker. Thus it is as though we were to say, "All who wish to leave they may go," “Where the sun never shines I couldn't live there," or "The girl with whom you were speaking she is my sis ter." Such correlatives are marked by a series of pronouns, adjectives, and adverbs corresponding to the interrogative and relative markers. The pronouns in this case are none other than those you have already learned as demonstra tive pronouns (5.5). With the exception of the 92410 (prathamā eka) of the foş (pumlinga) and Fit (striliñga), H (sah) and HI (sā), all these forms begin with the sound (t). Examples:

यः सीतया सह वनं गच्छति स रामः । yaḥ sītayā saha vanam gacchati sa rāmaḥ. (Rāma is the one who goes to the forest with Sītā.)

यया सह रामो वनं गच्छति सा सीता । yayā saha rāmo vanam gacchati sā sitā. (Sitā is the one with whom Rāma goes to the forest.)

यत्र वसति रामस्तत्र वसति सीता yatra vasati rāmas tatra vasati sitā. (Sitā lives where Rāma lives.)

6.4

Knowledge of this 7-a (y-t) set of markers is essential in that it enables one quickly to break up seemingly imposing sentences into simple, easily manageable units.Example: यया (कन्यया] सह वनं गच्छति दशरथस्य पुत्रस्तामहं पश्यामि । yayā (kanyayā] saha vanam gacchati daśarathasya putras tām aham paśyāmi. (I see her (the girl] with whom the son of Dasaratha is going to the forest.) In this sentence the 4-a (y-t) (relative correlative) correspon dence 71 (yayā) / 14 (tām) shows us that we have two clauses with a common referent. (For convenience we will use the most common prose word order for such clauses according to which the relative and the correlative marker each appear at the beginning of their respective clauses.) Each clause may now be read as a separate entity, each with its own syntax. Thus the independent clause is the simple sentence: DIE 434114 (tām aham paśyāmi—I see her), while the relative clause is the simple sentence: कन्यया सह वनं गच्छति रामः (vayā saha vanam gacchati rāmaḥ-Rāma goes to the forest with a girl), made relative by the substitution of the appropriate rela tive pronoun. 3Top146-s (Avyayapada-s-Indeclinables) of the 7-7-77 (k-y t) series. The 3TopyG-s (avyayapada-s-indeclinables) belonging to this series are adverbs with a variety of meanings, which are more or less closely related to the basic case system and each of which is represented by a particular ending or letter.

The meanings, corresponding case (if any), and distinctive. endings are shown in the following chart.

They may also be added to a variety of other pronominal (and in a few cases nominal) stems to form adverbs with the same general meanings. This is especially so in the case of the pronominally declined adjectives listed at 5.7. Some of the more common and useful of these forms are: - 21 (-thā): 3R (anyathā) otherwise

सर्वथा (sarvathā) every which way -2: (-tah): 37 : (anyataḥ) from another source

(ekataḥ) from one side,

on the one hand सर्वतः

(sarvataḥ) from all sides -a (-da): 3PIGI (anyadā) another time

एकदा (ekada) once, one time

सर्वदा (sarvadā) always, all the time -त्र (-tra): अन्यत्र (anyatra) elsewhere

एकत्र (ekatra) in one place

(sarvatra) everywhere परत्र (paratra) in another place,

in the next world

सर्वत्र

4147 (Sarvanāman-Pronouns) of the 6-4-(k-y-t) series. The same 06-7-7 (k-y-t) correspondence exists throughout the regular pronominal system. If the third person demonstrative pronouns given in 5.5 are taken as the correlatives, then the relatives are formed simply by substituting (y) for the initial consonant (s) or a (t) of the desired form. The interrogatives are likewise formed by the substitution of a (k) for the initial, except in the case of the 2441 (prathamā) and faciem co TyHP (dvitiyā ekao napusaka), where the very common interrogative for (kim—what) is substi tuted for तत् (tat)—यत् (yat). Usage of 57-4-1 (k-y-t) Series Pronouns In order for there to be true correlation between two pronomi nal items, one relative and one correlative, they must, of course, agree in gender and in number. The gender of the person, place, thing, action, etc., is inherent. The number is depen dent upon the context. One feature of this type of compound sentence, however, is often confusing to the beginner and should be made clear at the outset. This is the fact that the case of the relative need not be the same as that of its correlative. For, unlike gender and number, case is strictly a function of a given syntactical sequence, i.e., of the relation of words in a clause. As we saw at 6.4, each clause in such a sentence is itself a syntactical unit. Consider the following sentence:

येषां राक्षसानां रावणो नृपस्तान्हन्ति रामः । yeşām rākṣasānām rāvaņo nặpas tān hanti rāmaḥ. (Rāma kills the demons whose king is Rāvana.)

Here the noun TATA (rākşasa) plays a role in both clauses. The gender is, of course, to (pumlinga). Since the context re quires many TA-s (rākṣasa-s), the number must be E° (bahu°). Regarding the cases, however, each clause must be treated individually. In the independent clause, the T&H-S (rākşasa-s) represented by the correlative pronoun are the

104

(karman-direct object) of the verbal root VT (han). There fore, the word must be in the Pacite (dvitiyā). In the relative clause, however, the shel (karty—subject) of the verbal root V376 (as) (understood), the king of the demons, is in the geht (prathamā) while the relativised demons must be put in the appropriate 481 (sasthi). Examples:

येन पुरुषेण सह भाषते नृपः स मुनिः । yena puruṣeņa saha bhāşate nạpaḥ sa munih. (The man with whom the king is speaking, (he) is a sage.)

यस्मिन्वने वसति रामस्तस्मिन्वने न विद्यन्ते राक्षसाः । yasmin vane vasati rāmas, tasmin vane na vidyante rākṣasāḥ. (In the forest where Rāma lives, (in that forest) there are no demons.)

याभ्यां सह गच्छति सीता तौ रामश्च लक्ष्मणश्च । yābhyām saha gacchati sītā, tau rāmaś ca lakṣmaṇaś ca. (The two with whom Sitā is going are Rāma and Laksmana.)

यस्यान्या गतिर्नास्ति स संस्कृतं पठति । yasyānyā gatir nāsti, sa samskstam pathati. (Who has nothing else to do, he studies Sanskrit.)

यस्मानोद्विजते लोको लोकानोद्विजते च यः स मे प्रिय इति वदति श्रीकृष्णः । yasmān nodvijate loko lokān nodvijate ca yaḥ, sa me priya iti vadati śrīkrsṇaḥ. (On account of whom the world does not tremble, and who does not tremble on account of the world, he is dear to me, so says Srīkęsņa.)

6.16

It should be clear that learning the above indeclinables and pronouns will provide you with powerful tools for generating complex sentences, especially in response to a specific question. Such questions and answers, with respect to a specific story or reading, form a major part of the traditional method of Sanskrit instruction.

105

6.17

6.18

Indefinite and Absolute Negative Constructions These same forms of the interrogative and relative adverbs and pronouns may be used in conjuction with a few simple particles to generate phrases indicating indefiniteness and absolute negativity. A very simple technique to indicate indefiniteness is to use the corresponding relative and interrogative in succession, often following the pair by the particle 319 (api). Examples: 47119 (yatra kutrāpi) somewhere or other 2 S yyria (yena kenāpy upāyena) by some means or other, by hook or by crook

The interrogative alone followed by the particles 3779 (api), a (cana), or Fac (cit) serves to indicate something not really specified. This construction often has a force similar to that of the indefinite article in English. It is especially common where the name of a person or place is not specified or not important. Examples: मह्यं किंचिद्वदति । mahyam kimcid vadati. (He tells me something.)

6.19

तत्र कश्चन ब्राह्मणो वसति । tatra kaścana brāhmaṇo vasati. (A [Some) brāhman lives there.)

कस्मिंश्चिन्नगरे वसति स्म नृपः । kasmimś cin nagare vasati sma nộpaḥ (The king lived in a (some) city.)

6.20

The addition of the negative particle 7 (na) to one of the above phrases indicates absolute exclusion or negativity. Examples: न कश्चन शृणोति माम् । na kaścana śīņoti mām. (Nobody listens to me.)

106

न कयापि कन्यया सह संवदति । na kayāpi kanyayā saha samvadati. (He is not speaking with any girl.)

न मे नश्यति किंचन । na me naśyati kimcana. (Nothing of mine is destroyed.)

6.21

Negation Negation in Sanskrit is basically of two kinds. These may be called propositional negation, whereby a verbal phrase is negated, and term negation, whereby a nominal item alone is negated. In propositional negation the negative particle 7 (na) (or 1 [mā); see 11.18) is inserted into the clause, normally before the finite verb if it is expressed. Examples: रामो वनं न गच्छति । rāmo vanam na gacchati. (Rāma doesn't go to the forest.)

नाहं ब्राह्मणः । nāham brāhmaṇaḥ. (I am not a brāhman.)

In term negation, a nominal item alone may be negated by the prefixation of the syllable 37 (a), similar in meaning to English un-, in-, non-, im-, etc. If the item begins with a vowel, the prefix is 37 (an). Examples: तदसमीचीनं भवति । tad asamicīnam bhavati. (That is not good.)

अनार्याः कुत्र वसन्ति । anāryāḥ kutra vasanti? (Where do non-āryans live?)

7.2

The Present System The present system comprises an extensive complex of tenses, modes, and participles, which together make up the most sig nificant coherent portion of the Sanskrit verbal system. The "present" system is the basis for the लट् (lat-present indica

114

7.3

: 7.4

7.5

tive), the 5 (lan—imperfect), the MTC (lot-imperative), the विधि लिङ् (vidhi lin optative) and the वर्तमाने कृदन्त (vartanane krdanta–present participle). These together make up a great portion of verbal forms actually in use. All these different forms are said to belong to a single system because of the fact that regardless of which personal endings, modal signs, or verbal prefixes they may involve, they all share a common feature. All are formed from a special verbal base derived from the verbal roots, UTC -s (dhātu-s), by several pro cesses. This base is called the present stem. The 10-8 (Gaņa-s) of the Present System A few verbal roots, UC -s (dhātu-s), have no forms belonging to the present system. The great majority of roots, ETC -s (dhātu s), however, do have such forms. These roots, HTC -s (dhātu s), are divided into ten separate conjugations classes, called 107-s (gana-s) according to the way in which their present stem, the base for conjugation, is formed. To form their present stems, the roots belonging to the differ ent 10-s (gana-s) may be augmented in: one or both of two ways: 1. By the addition of a characteristic TT (gana) sign.

a) It may be (and is in eight of the ten 30-s (gana-s])

suffixed to the root. b) It may be (as in the third 1 [gana]) prefixed into the

root. c) It may be (as in the seventh 7 (gaña]) infixed to the

root itself. 2. By Jo (guņa) (see 3.7) of the root vowel in some or all of

the forms of the paradigm. The 10-s (gaņa-s) are ten in number and are so numbered by traditional grammarians. They are also given names based on a typical root for each (gaña). Thus, the first class is named for the root (Vbhū—to be) and is called agit (bhvādigaña) or the MM (gaņa) consisting of 4 (Vbhū), etc. We can call this the 470 (bhū gaña).

7.6

115

7.7

"a" Tu-s (gaņa-s) and "non-a" 141-(gana-s) Although the fact is not indicated by any grouping in the tradi tional ordering, the ten 10-s (gaņa-s) fall typologically into two basic groups: 1. Those whose qui (gana) sign either is or ends in the

vowel 31 (a) and is suffixed to the root, and 2. All other 7-s (gaņa-s). The major difference that should be grasped between the two groups is that roots of the first group (the "a" group) form a present stem that, once formed, is invariable throughout the conjugation(s) regardless of changes of number and voice, while roots of the second group (“non-a") form stems that are liable to variation, by a change either in the root or in the gana

7.8

7.9

7.10

Strong and Weak Forms Roots of the “non-a" Tu-s (gana-s) have, in sharp contrast to those of the "a" Tu-s (gana-s), stronger and weaker stem forms. The basis for the strong/weak distinction in the "non-a" T-s (gana-s) is quite simple and regular and must be memorized at once. The only strong forms are: 1. The three cool ala P 4C (ekavacana parasmaipada)

persons of the c (lat) and 5 (lan-imperfect (Lesson

8]).

2. The प्रथमपुरुष एकवचन परस्मैपद (prathamapurusa ekavacana

parasmaipada) and all 3714454 (uttamapuruṣa) forms (परस्मैपद [parasmaipada] and आत्मनेपद [ātmanepada] re gardless of number) of the DTC (lo-imperative (Lesson

11]). In other words, with regard to the SC (lat), the only conjuga tion that you need concern yourself with at the moment, only the three 100097 RAG (ekavacana parasmai pada) forms are strong. All others (i.e., oazh 3764146 (ekavacara ātmanepada] and all Tao (dvivacana) and 6° [bahuvacana]) are weak.

116

7.11.

The traditional list of the Tu-s (gana-s) is given below. Each is listed with its traditional number and name, the 2 (gana) sign, the stem strength, if any, and the 944 Pocah Me (prathmapuruşa ekavacana lat) of the root which names the

1° (gaña). The problems of the individual -s (gaņa-s) will be discussed separately below.

The remainder of this lesson deals in greater detail with the individual 7-s (gana-s), their irregularities, and the most com mon and useful roots of each class. Where indicated, particular roots, with their present stem, should be learned immediately.

118

7.14

The first, or (Vbhū gaña) This is perhaps the most important of all the 10-s (gaña-s). Most of the verbs that we have already encountered belong to this class. To form their present stems, 31 (a) is suffixed to the root, whose vowel takes 1 (guna) (3.7) if possible (see 7.16). The personal endings are added to this stem. Examples:

El + 37 → 245 + fa → isia Vtyaj + a → tyaja + ti → tyajati (he, she, it abandons)

4 + 37 +47 +34 + 4 + 37 + fat → Hvala Vbhū + a bho + a → bhav + a + ti → bhavati (he, she, it is) (see 3.13.b)

Da + 37 → +31 +→ ada Vvrt + a + vart + a + te → vartate (he, she, it is/exists)

F +31 57 +31 +374 +37 + → spila Vji + a → je + a → jay + a + ti → jayati (he, she, it conquers) (3.13.a)

G + 37 → G + → Gift Vvad + a + vada + mi → vadāmi (see 4.22) (I say)

7.15

Irregular Roots of the L 79 (Vbhū gaña) a. A few roots with nasalized vowels lose the nasalization

in the formation of the present stem.

Example: दंश् → दशति Vdams → daśati (he, she, it bites)

सर्पस्तं दशति । sarpas tam daśati. (The snake bites him.)

b. Two very important roots of the 4 m (Vbhū gaña) lose

their final consonants and replace them with the conjunct TBD (-cch-).119

Examples:

गम्

रामो गच्छति । rāmo gacchati. (Rāma goes.)

Vgam

यम् सीता यच्छति । Vyam sītā yacchati. (Sītā gives.) Learn these roots.

c.

The root HG (Vsad—to sit) has an irregular present stem, Hic (sida). Example: अर्जुनो विषीदति । arjuno vişīdati. (Arjuna sinks down in despair.)

d. The two important roots FT (Vsthā—stand, be located)

and (pā—drink) are conjugated on the basis of the ir regular stems fas (tişțha), and 196 (piba), respectively. Examples: Gal: Ati Rahi devāḥ somam pibanti. (The gods drink soma.)

रामश्च सीता च कुत्र तिष्ठतः । rāmaś ca sītā ca kutra tişthatah? (Where are Rāma and Sītā standing?)

7.16

Exceptions to regular Ju (guna) strength There are two instances in which a root vowel, even though it should be subjected to Jul (guna), is exempt from this strength ening.

1. A long root vowel followed by a final consonant. 2. Any root vowel followed by a final consonant cluster. Examples:

5114 (1P) → silaha Vjīv (1P) (lives) jīvati (he lives). The root vowel $ (i) is by rule 1 above not subject to Jul (guna) even though first Tu (gana) roots normally take it.

120

Pam (10P) → Paralla Vcint (10P) (thinks) → cintayati (he thinks). Here 3 (i) is ex empt from Ju (guņa) by rule 2 even though tenth 1 (gaña) roots normally take it.

7.17

7.18

The second, or 3TC (Vad gana) This 2 (gana) is sometimes referred to as “root class" be cause of the fact that its present stem is the same as the root. This results from the fact that this 1 (gaña) has no character istic Tu (gana) sign. The root vowel takes y (guna) in the strong forms (7.10). Internal Consonant H (Sandhi) In this and several of the other non-a Tu-s (gana-s), the present stem may often end in a consonant, which must then be fre quently placed in juxtaposition with an initial consonant of an ending. This brings into play a number of internal HU (san dhi) rules. Some of the more important of these rules will be mentioned here and at other appropriate points. a. A voiced non-aspirated 8421 (sparsa) before any non

voiced of (vyanjana) (as in absolute final position) is changed to its corresponding non-voiced 6427 (sparsa). Example: fac + fet + afa Vvid (2P) (know) + ti → vetti (he knows)

b. A FYR (sparśa) or a nasal of the Great asof (dantya varga)

following any sound of the qua qof (mūrdhanya varga) or the HR 3647 (mūrdhanya ūşman"s") is changed to its corresponding A (mūrdhanya) sound. Example: fim + → Stee

Vdvis (2P) (hate) + ti → dvești (he hates)

121

c. The sound ($), when it precedes the sound (s), is gen

erally changed to (k). The following 7 (s) is then (by rule 3.58) changed itself into (s). Example: face + → Vdviş (2P) (hate) + si → dvekși (you hate)

d. A nasal before H (s) is changed to 37tar (anusvāra).

Example: 6 + → ETH Vhan (2P) (kill) + si → hamsi (you kill)

e. Root final when it precedes any 435A (vyañjana) other

than a nasal or the 37:29 7 (antahstha "v"), is treated as though it were the sound (k) in the same position. Example:

+ af Vvac (2P) (speak) + ti → vakti (he speaks)

E + f + alat Vvac (2P) (speak) + si → vakși (you speak) (See c. above)

7.19

Some Examples of Second Tu (gana) Forms Examples: 5 + fa → efa Vi (go) + ti (strong) → eti (he goes)

3 + : → 54: Vi (go) + mah (weak) → imah (we go)

3 + 31 → Vi (go) + anti (weak) →yanti (they go) face + → Stat Ndviş (hate) + si (strong) → dveksi (you hate)

122

द्विष् + अन्ति → द्विषन्ति

Vdviş (hate) + anti (weak) → dvişanti (they hate) fac + → area Vvid (know) + mi (strong) → vedmi (I know) fac + a: → fag Vvid (know) + vah (weak) → vidvah (we two know)

Irregular Roots of the 3G m (Vad gana) a. By far the most important root of the J14 (gaņa) is 316L

(Vas-be). It is irregular in that it loses its initial vowel in weak forms of all parts of the present system except the 076 (imperfect) and loses its (s) before the (s) of the 4244° 3° RHYC (madhyamao ekao parasmaipada) ending. This paradigm, given at 4.24, should by now have

been memorized b. The very common root ? (Vbrū-speak, say) takes the

additional vowel $ (i) between its strong stem and an ini tial consonant of an ending. Examples: ब्रवीमि bravimi (I say)

ब्रवीति bravīti (he says)

but:

4 brūmah (we say)

बते

brūte (A) (he says) The consonant (v) is inserted before endings beginning with a vowel and the root vowel is shortened. Examples: बुवन्ति bruvanti (they speak)

123

बवते bruvate (A) (they speak) (see 4.22.e)

This root does not occur outside the present system. C. The roots EC (Vrud—weep) and 494 (Vsvap-sleep) insert

5 (i) before consonant initial endings. Examples: स्वपिति नृपः । svapiti nạpah. (The king sleeps.)

कस्माद्रोदिषि देवि । kasmād rodiși devi (Why are you weeping, lady?)

d. The common root & (Vhan-kill) is rather peculiar in that

before consonant initial endings (except [m] and 7 [v]), the weak stem loses its 7(n), while before an vowel initial endings, the weak stem loses its vowel 31 (a). In the latter case the initial (h) is changed to q (gh). The paradigm is as follows:

G (Vhan) (2P)

7.21

The third, or 71 (Vhu gana) The third Tu (gaña) is unique in that its (gana) sign is prefixed to the root. The sign is even more striking in that it

124

has no fixed form for the whole class but takes its form from the phonological structure of each root. It is in fact a sort of echo syllable or "reduplication," which the Indian grammar ians call 372H (abhyāsa), or repetition. General Rules of 3121H (Abhyāsa)

The basic rules of “reduplication" (which also apply to a num ber of forms outside the present system) are that the 3P3H (abhyāsa) syllable represents a part of the root. A root begin ning with a vowel will have an 3p2TH (abhyāsa) syllable con sisting of that vowel, or of the vowel and a following conso nant. For a root beginning with a consonant or consonant clus ter, the 37TH (abhyāsa) will consist of that consonant or the first consonant of that cluster, and the following vowel. Specific Rules for the & (Vhu gana) a. A root vowel generally appears in its short form in 3721H

(abhyāsa). Example: al (Vdā-give) →GGI (dadā) = present stem, but

7.23

b. Root vowel + (r) is changed to 5 (i) in 38-2014

(abhyāsa). Example:

(Vbhr-bear) or (bibhr) = present stem.

c. As is evident in the previous example, an initial aspirated

consonant is represented in 37H (abhyāsa) by its non aspirated counterpart: Example: U (Vdhāput) → GUT (dadhā) = present stem.

d. An initial Duda (kanthya-velar) is represented by the

Hoyou (tālavya-palatal) corresponding to it in voicing, while initial (h) is replaced by (i). Example:

(Vhu-sacrifice) → (juhu) = present stem.

125

7.24

Strong forms of the present stem show Jul (guņa) of the root vowel. Examples:

(Vbhr-bear) →

Panifa (bibharti–he bears)

Pau (bibhrmaḥ—we bear) & (Thu—offer as a sacrifice) → TEA (juhomi—I offer)

364 (juhumaḥ—we offer)

7.25

It is an important peculiarity of this 4 (gaña) that its roots regularly require the loss of the न् (n) of the प्रथम बहु° परस्मैपद (prathamao bahuo parasmaipada) ending, not only (as with other non-a 14-(gaņa-s]) in the 371CH1YG (ātmane pada). Examples: जुहोति juhoti (he offers)

juhvati (they offer)

बिभेति bibheti (he is afraid)

बिभ्यति bibhyati (they are afraid)

7.26

Irregular roots of the 10 (Thu gaña) There are two extremely common roots belonging to the GM (Vhu gaña) that require special attention and with which you must become familiar.

a. These roots al (Vdā-give) and UI (Vdha-place, put) are

alike in completely losing their root vowel in all weak forms. Examples: ददाति dadāti (he gives) (strong)

126

GCT:

dadmah (we give) (weak)

दधाति dadhāti (he puts) (strong)

दधति dadhati (they put) (weak) When the 4 (dh) of the weak stem 4 (dadh) comes di rectly before the (t), 9 (th), or (s) of an ending, it becomes a (t) and its lost aspiration reappears in the initial of the 3721H (abhyāsa) syllable. Example: YA: dhattaḥ (the two place)

7.27

The fourth, or faq u (Vdiv gaña) The Mu (gana) sign is 9 (ya). It is suffixed to the root, which takes no strength. Examples:

नश्यति Vnaś → naśyati (he is destroyed)

नश्यामि

naśyāmi (I am destroyed) Some common roots of this Top (gaņa) are:

→ Vkup (P) (be angry) kupyati (he is angry)

कुप

क्रुध्

क्रुध्यति krudhyati (he is angry)

Wkrudh (P) (be angry)

मन्

मन्ये

Vman (A) (think)

manye (I think)

127

7.28

7.29

The fifth, or I (vsu) and eighth, or (Ntan) 74-8 (gana-s) These two T-s (gana-s) are treated very similarly. The Tu (gana) sign of the (vsu) class is 3 (nu), and that of the (Vtan) class is 3 (u); but, as almost all of the roots of the latter end in 7 (n), the two conjugations show few differences. Rules for the I (vsu) and a 10-s (Vtan gana-s) a. The final vowel of the stem 3 (u) is subject to Jul (guna)

in the strong forms. Examples:

सुनोति 1974: Vsu (press) → sunoti

sunumah

तन्

तनोति

14: tanumah

Vtan (stretch) →

tanoti

b. The 3 (u) of the weak forms of either To (gana) may be

dropped optionally before the H (m) or q (v) of fào (dvio) and 6 (bahu°) endings. (vsu gana) roots with final consonants are an exception to this. Examples: CA 94 / 14 Vtan — anumaḥ or tanmaḥ

Vsu

→

sunuvaḥ or sunvaḥ

but 314

Vāp →

आप्नुमः āpnumaḥ (we obtain)

7.30

The most important roots of these 10-s (gana-s) to learn are:

Vkr (8P) (do, make)

Víru (5P) (hear, hear about, listen) आप Vāp (5P) (get, obtain) The first two are somewhat irregular. a. (Vkr) is one of the most common and useful roots in the

language and, like 1 (Vbhū) and 37 (Vas), must be memo rized. It is somewhat irregular in that:

128

i. It is the only root of the A 70 (Utan gana) that does

not have a root-final 7 (n). ii. Both its strong and weak forms are irregular in that:

a) Strong forms involve qui (guna) of both the root

vowel + (r) and the Th (gana) sign vowel 3 (u). The strong stem, then, is opel (karo).

Examples: करोति karoti (he does)

कशोषि karoși (you do)

करोमि karomi (I do)

b) In weak forms, the root changes to F (kur).

The weak stem, then, is (kuru). Example: कुरुतः kurutah (the two do)

iii. As a corollary to rule 7.29.b, weak forms of F (Hkr)

always lose the 3 (u) vowel of the Th (gana) sign before 7 (m) and (v) of fão (dvio) and 6 (bahu°) endings. Example:

kurmah (we do)

b. The roots (Váru) becomes I (Vśr) before the 7 (gaña)

sign. Thus the paradigm is yunta (śrņoti), Yuga: (śrņutaḥ), guap (śrnvanti), etc.129

7.31

The sixth, or T T (Vtud gaña) This alu (gana), like the 41 (Vbhū gana), has 37 (a) as its Tu (gana) sign and behaves just like that TT (gana) except that its roots never take ju (guna) before the fu (gana) sign. Example: नुद्

नुदति Vnud (push) nudati (he pushes)

7.32

a. A few relatively common roots of this m (gaña) are

strengthened before the app (gana) sign by the infixation of a nasal before, and corresponding to the root final con sonant. Examples:

मुञ्चति Vmuc (release) → muñcati

मुच

सिच

Vsic (sprinkle) →

सिञ्चति siñcati

विद्

Vvid (find) →

विन्दति vindati

b. The common root 59 (vis-wish, want) forms the present

stem şticcha). Example: इच्छामि icchāmi (I want)

7.33

The seventh, or a 79 (Vrudh gaña) Roots of this all (gaña) are relatively few in number and all end in consonants. The Tu (gana) sign is a nasal consonant, homorganic with the root-final consonant and infixed imme diately before it. In the strong forms, the sign is strengthened to the syllable 7 (na).

130

7.34

Internal Consonant H (Sandhi) The seventh 20 (gaña), like the second, presents a few prob lems of internal consonant HP (sandhi). The following rules are applicable: a. A nasal immediately preceding a F431 (sparśa) is changed

to the nasal of the same af (varga) as that F421 (sparsa). Example:

युज

Vyuj (yoke, join) + infix 7 (n) → (weak stem) out (yunj);

युञ्ज yuñj

-तः -taḥ

युतः → yuñktaḥ (the two join)

+

Rootfinal (1) of several roots that belong to this p (gana) is treated exactly like root final Z (c). (See 7.18.e) Example:

- 15979: Vyuj + -tah yuñkthah (you two join)

युज

c. i.

An aspirated Fyzf (sparśa) loses its aspiration when it occurs immediately before any +47 (sparśa) or 3,0477 (ūşman). Example:

रुध

रुन्त्से

rudh (Ā)

►

runtse (you block)

ii. If a root final voiced aspirate FYR (sparśa) (except as

in 7.26.b) precedes initial al (t) or 4 (th) of an ending, the (t) or (th) is voiced and aspirated. Examples:

Fa Vrudh (block, prevent) strong stem रुणध् (runadh) + ति (ti) → Bull (ruņaddhi-he blocks)

weak stem 54 (rundh) + a: (taḥ) ►

5-6 (runddhaḥ—the two block)

131

7.35

Some Examples of 4 T (Vrudh gana) roots: A few relatively common opit (Vrudh gaña) roots, with some examples are: y (Vyuj-join) युनक्ति (yunakti—he joins)

युज्मः (yuñjmaḥ—we join) E (Vbhuj—eat) भुनक्षि (bhunakşi-you eat)

भुञ्जन्ति (bhuñjanti—they eat) छिद् (Vchid-cut) छिनत्ति (chinatti-he cuts)

(See 7.18.a) forafa (chindanti—they cut)

7.36

The ninth, or yu (Vkri gaña) This 7 (gaña) has relatively few roots of common occurrence. The Mu (gana) sign is the syllable (ni) suffixed to the unstrengthened root. In the strong forms, the suffix is 71 (nā). The $ (1) of the weak stem is lost before endings beginning with a vowel. Examples: क्री क्रीणाति Vkri krīnāti (he buys)

क्रीणीमः krīņīmah (we buy)

क्रीणन्ति krīņanti

(they buy)

7.37

The most important and common root of the Tu (gana), I (Vjñā—know), is irregular in that it loses its own root-nasal 37 (ñ) before the 10 (gana) sign or, in other words, throughout its entire present conjugation. Example:

जानाति

जानीमः

जानन्ति jānāti,

jānīmah, jānanti, etc.

ज्ञा

Vjñā,

132

जानामि धर्मं न च मे प्रवृत्तिः । जानाम्यधर्म न च मे निवृत्तिः ।। jānāmi dharmam naca me pravsttiḥ. jānāmy adharmam na ca me nivịttiḥ. (I know what's right, but I don't do it. I know what's wrong, but I don't stop.) Memorize this example and the forms of this useful root.

7.38

The tenth, or T (Vcur gana) This Tu (gana) has very few roots. Its Tu (gana) sign is 377 (aya), which is suffixed to the root. It is thus like the other "a"

M-s (gaņa-s). The root vowel is strengthened by Jul (guna). Perhaps the most common root in this 10 (gana) is Ford (Vcint—think) (see 7.16.2). Example: चिन्तयति चिन्तयामि चिन्तयन्ति

## 08 Noun Stem Strength; Noun Stems in-अन्; अनद्यतनभूते लङ्, The Imperfect; उपसर्ग-s (Upasarga-s)

8.0

8.1

All the noun stems introduced thus far have ended in vowels. This is not the case, however, with all nouns. Several classes of nouns have stems with consonant finals. These stems (and some vowel stems—see below, 10.0), unlike the nouns so far learned, have a distinction of stem strength. Noun Stem Strength a. Of पुंलिङ्ग and स्त्रीलिङ्ग stems, the only strong forms are प्रथमा

Pahit, 2004, ferea, and bea; and the reciten fant, एकवचन, and द्विवचन. The rest are weaker. Some stems further distinguish, among the weaker forms, a weak and a weakest, depending upon whether the inflectional ending

begins with a consonant (weak) or a vowel (weakest). b. Of नपुंसकलिङ्ग stems, only the प्रथमा and द्वितीया बहुवचन are

strong. If the stem distinguishes degree of weakness, the प्रथमा and द्वितीया एकवचन are weak while the same cases of the face are the weakest. Other cases are, as usual, the

same as the corresponding is stems. Noun Stems in -37 (-an)

An important class of consonant stems ends in -367 (-an). These stems are all पुंलिङ्ग or नपुंसकलिङ्ग. Try to learn these nouns in both stem and nominative singular form. If only the first is leamed, you will not know the gender; if only the second, you are apt to forget the stem ending and confuse the nouns with those of the -31 (-a) or -371 (-a) classes. Strength in-341 (-an) Stems The strong forms show the last vowel of the stem as - 31 (-ā), the weak as - 31 (-a), and the weakest as Ø (i.e., the vowel is lost). The difference in the degree of the strong-weak distinc

8.2

tion has to do with the place of accentual strength at an earlier stage of the language. This also accounts for the strength in the present system. This type of accentuation is absent in clas sical Sanskrit, although its effects are clearly seen. In dealing with this class of nouns, it is wise to learn the paradigms of the important items thoroughly. As an aid to memory, however, keep in mind a short sentence incorporating the instrumental singular form of each item. This case shows the weakest form if there is one. For practical purposes keep in mind that stems whose second consonant is part of a conjunct (e.g., 3114427 (ātman), ci [karman]) show the strong/weak alternation while others (e.g., T5F! [rājan), 147] [nāman]) show the strong/weak/ weakest alternation. Examples:

राज्ञा विना राज्यं नश्यति । rājñā vinā rājyam naśyati. (Without a king, the kingdom perishes.)

कर्मणा विना न कश्चन जीवति । karmaņā vinā na kaścana jīvati. (Nobody lives without karma.)

आत्मनात्मानं जानाति पण्डितः । ātmanātmānam jānāti panditaḥ (The wise man knows the Self by means of the Self.)

अयोध्यायां राजा वर्तते दशरथो नाम्ना । ayodhyāyām rājā vartate daśaratho nāmnā. (There is a king in Ayodhyā, Dasaratha by name.)

8.4

Typical Case Endings Note the case endings of these nouns. Although these and other stems are statistically outnumbered by the -31 (-a) and - 371 (-ā) classes, these endings are really the typical" ones for each case. This is especially important to note in the social139

weak cases. The proper endings then, for consonant and many vowel stems are: तृतीया_आ चतुर्थी—ए पञ्चमी—अः षष्ठी-अः सप्तमी—इ Memorize these endings as quickly as possible.

अनघ

(Anadyatanabhūte Lan); The Imperfect This is one of the several verbal (and nominal-verbal) forms used to indicate preterite or "past" time in Sanskrit. All of these forms are best translated as “simple past" tenses in En glish. Keep clearly in mind that terms like "imperfect" have been given by Western grammarians as classifiers on the basis of parallels with grammars of classical languages. They do not indicate anything with regard to the "aspect" or degree of duration or repetition of the action or state suggested by a ver bal root. Even the Sanskrit name 3AERAYA (past time prior to today) serves now only as a classifier. The form is by no means actually restricted in its application as the name would sug gest. The 5 is formed mechanically from the present stems of the previous lesson. Once these are learned, the 35 is quite simple and so has the virtue of greatly expanding your ability to use the language with a minimum of new memorization. Formation of the लङ् The 5 is formed from the appropriate present stems by two simple steps: 1. A preterite augment: the syllable 37 (a) is prefixed to the

stem. This augment, or 31714 (āgama), which is used with some other past tenses, is peculiar phonologically in that it combines with root initial vowels to form the art of the initial instead of the expected (3.7) M. Example:

8.7

8.8

Vi (2P) (go)

+ 3 a (augment)+ i (weak stem) → ai (weak stem of 5)

2. To the appropriate stems (strong or weak as at 7.10.1)

are directly suffixed the appropriate "secondary" endings.

8.9

The Secondary Endings for the लङ् (lan) are:

प्रथम

एक

त् -t स्

परस्मैपद

आत्मनेपद द्वि बहु | एक द्वि बहु ताम् अन् / उः | त आताम् अन्त / अत / रन् -tam -an/uh | -ta -atam -anta/ata/ran

तम्

थाः आथाम् ध्वम् -tam

-thah -atham -dhvam व म । इ/ए वहि महि -va __-ma | -i/e -vahi -mahi

मध्यम

उत्तम

अम् -am

8.10

It is evident that they are often closely related to the "primary" endings but are shorter or lighter. The उत्तम° एक° आतत्मनेपद ending 5 (i) regularly combines with the 31 (a) of a preceding गण sign to form ए (e). "अ" गण-s For the "a" गण-s the situation is quite simple and regular. Root प्रथम एक लट् प्रथम एक लङ् Meaning भू भवति

अभवत् Vbhū bhavati abhavat he was

अगच्छत agacchat

he went

गम् गच्छति Vgam gacchati

मन् मन्यते Vman manyate

अमन्यत

amanyata

he thought

कुप् Vkup

कुप्यति kupyati

अकुप्यत् akupyat

he was angry

Rules for adding the terminations are the same as those given at 4.22 above. The प्रथम बहु परस्मैपद takes the ending -अन् (-an). The प्रथम बहु आत्मनेपद takes the ending -अन्त (-anta).

144

Before these endings, and before the 3714°° RH4 ending -37 (-am), the 37 (a) of the Tu signs is lost. 371/7837 (agacchan) they went 31467 (abhavan) they were 31964 (avadam) I said 374PIR (amanyanta) they thought

8.11

"Non-3710-(gana-s) The "non-37" Tu-s are also generally regular, but there are a few points that require mention. a. The third, 5,- takes the ending 3: (uh) in 979°E 4 6. Before this ending the final vowel of the stem is subject to

. Examples: हु अजुहोत्

अजुहुताम् Vhu → ajuhot (he offered), ajuhutām (those two offered),

अजुहवुः but ajuhavuḥ (they offered).

b.

The seventh, 54, is quite regular, but note that the प्रथम° and मध्यम° of the strong forms present what appear to be anomalous endings because of the fact that their stem final consonants form, with the single consonants of the endings, conjuncts that must be resolved (see 3.25.f) by the loss of what are, here, the actual endings. Examples: Fl (Vbhuj-eat) (7P)

प्रथम

मध्यम (374 ) ► 374757 (377) → 37776 (abhunakt) → abhunak (abhunaks) → abhunak

The important root 376 (be) inserts the vowel $ (1) be tween the stem and the endings a (t) and (s) of the 5 yielding 3 ht: (āsiņ—you were) and the enormously com mon narrative tal (āsit—he, she, it was; or there was).

145

Example: आसीद्राजा दशरथो नाम । राज्ञो राज्ये बहवो मुनय आसन् । āsīd rājā daśaratho nāma. rājño rājye bahavo munaya āsan. (There was a king by the name of Dasaratha. There were many sages in the king's realm.)

3440f-s (Upasarga-s): Verbal Prefixes 341-s, or verbal prefixes, are one of a number of factors ac counting for the flexibility and richness of Sanskrit. The use of these simple, easily memorized prefixes greatly enhances the connotative power of the various verbal roots without any thing like the mental effort that would be required to memorize wholly different verbs for each meaning.

The 3441-s function basically in three ways, although these func tions frequently overlap and are not consistent for all 3421-s or even for the same one with different roots. Wemay classify their function as: a. pleonastic: This is the case in which the prefixation of an

34701 does not substantially alter the basic meaning of a verbal root. Example: 34 +374 → 345978 = a upa + Vlabh (1Ā) (obtain) → upalabhate = labhate (gain, obtain, acquire)

analytic: Here the 34481 has a particular semantic value of its own, by which it modifies or qualifies the meaning of a verbal root. Example:

अव +तु → अवतरति ava (down) + VtỊ (1P) (cross) → avatarati (he descends)

c. idiomatic: Here the combination of an 341 and a root

yields a meaning not clearly related to either.

146

Examples: 319 + 374 → 34tofa ava (down) + Vgam (1P) (go) → avagacchati (he understands)

अनु + ज्ञा → अनुजानाति anu (after) + Vjñā (9P) (know) ► anujānāti (he permits)

8.14

In any given case, the same combination of 34671 and verbal root may be used in any of these three ways. The context and usage must always be considered. Examples: 379 +374 → 37 tofa ava (down) + Vgam (go) → avagacchati—(a) he understands; (b) he goes down

34 + 4 → 34947 upa + Vlabh (obtain) → upalabhate-(a) he obtains; (b) he leams, knows

It should be kept in mind that the above examples are by no means intended to be exhaustive of the uses of the उपसर्ग-s. Rather they are to suggest some of the common applications of these important prefixes.

There is no restriction as to the number of 34ri-s that may precede a given verbal form or its derivatives. Two and sometimes three may be strung together before a root to give some additional shade of meaning.

152

Examples: उद् + आ + ह → उदाहरति ud + a + Vhr (1P) → udāharati (he gives an illustration)

सम् + आ + गम् → समागच्छन्ति sam + ā + Vgam (1P) → samāgacchanti (they convene)

अभि + उप + आ + इ → अभ्युपैति abhi + upa +ā + Vi (2P) → abhyupaiti (he approaches, agrees)

8.18

Placement of उपसर्ग-s (upasarga-s) An उपसर्ग or series of उपसर्ग-s is placed immediately before the verbal form that it modifies. However, in the case of preterite tenses such as the 35, which require the preterite augment (आगम), it is the augment that immediately precedes the verbal stem, while the उपसर्ग-s, if any, must precede the augment.

Examples:

लट उप + विश्

उपविशति

उपाविशत् upa + vvis (6P) (sit) | upavisati (he sits) | upāvisat (he sat)

लङ्

नि + वस् ni + vvas (1P)

निवसति nivasati

न्यवसत् nyavasat

EXERCISES

A. B.

Translate the reading into English. Rewrite the reading, changing all the Mc forms into their corresponding 5 forms, and all the 5 forms into their corresponding Se forms. Translate the following sentences into Sanskrit: 1. When Rāma came for Sītā's Face (svayamvara), all the

kings ridiculed him. 2. None of the kings (lit., no king at all) lifted Siva's bow. 3. The sages did not understand what you said. (Put relative

clause first.) 4. Janaka stood up in the assembly (At-sabhā) of the kings

and said, “Rāma has won.” (Use çfa (iti]). 5. Finally the proud king became very angry (4 Vkrudh). 6. But the hero did not exert himself and did not break the

bow. 7. The proud queen forgot the name of the angry sage. 8. "O, Sambhu! You promised me a kingdom!” he said. 9. That woman never forgot her for (svayamvara). 10. The king's son, by name Devadatta, reviled Sambhu. 11. A fool does not easily obtain the Self. 12. "Why did he eat grass?" they thought. Memorize the following verse.

केयूरा न विभूषयन्ति पुरुषं हारा न चन्द्रोज्ज्वला

न स्नानं न विलेपनं न कुसुमं नालंकृता मूर्धजाः । वाण्येका समलंकरोति पुरुषं या संस्कृता धार्यते

क्षीयन्ते खलु भूषणानि सततं वाग्भूषणं भूषणम् ।।

Bracelets do not adorn a person, nor necklaces shining like the moon, not baths and ointments, flowers or jewelled coiffures. Only that speech which is refined (samsksta) adorns a person. Mere omaments will always fade; the ornament of speech is the only true ornament.

Noun Stems in अः (ah) There is another important class of nouns whose stems end in अः (an). They are mostly नपुंसकलिङ्ग nouns, and their declen sion is a good example of a regular consonantal paradigm.

पुलिङ्ग nounsending in अः (ah)arenotatall common, while स्त्रीलिङ्ग nouns with this ending are virtually nonexistent. However, by a process to be discussed at length later on (13.9.a), it is rather common for the नपुंसकलिङ्ग stems to be treated as adjectives. When this happens they must, of course, be declined in the gender of whatever they modify.

158

For this reason it is necessary to learn the appropriate para digm. In this instance the stars and Fits forms are the same. They are, moreover, different from the नपुंसकलिङ्ग forms only in the first two cases.

Adjectival application of these stems (13.9.a) take, in पुंलिङ्ग and Fill the same strong endings as do the stems in -31:

It is helpful to learn the important nouns of this class with the original final स् (s), the प्रथमा एक,and another case, preferably the तृतीया एक so that the absolute final, : (h), is not confused with that of the प्रथमा एक° ending of पुंलिङ्ग stems with final अ (a).

fot yet (Karmani Prayoga): The Sanskrit ‘Passive' [Note: Before proceeding with this section it is advisable to refer back for a moment to the sections on the uses of the ge, द्वितीया, and तृतीया विभक्ति-s (4.28)and to make surethatyou clearly understand the concepts of the subject) and 547 (direct ob ject) of a verbal root (4.40-42)]. All the clauses and sentences that we have thus far encountered have two important and re lated points in common: a. The fel (subject) of any ETC (verbal root) is in the 1941

fa (nominative case). b. The 1241146 (verb) of any clause always agrees in number

and person with the be (subject). For example, in the sentence quail frustra (pandito mūrkhāms tyajati-A wise man abandons fools), the verbal ending -ति (-ti) tells us that the कर्तृ is एकवचन. It also tell us that the person" of the subject is gennya. In fact, it is so specific that except for the actual name, type, or identity of the che, nothing else need be provided. This is especially clear in the case of the उत्तम and मध्यमपुरुष where the identity of the subject is already clear from the context. Thus, the - (-mi) of Taifa (gacchāmi—I go) is so specific that the inclusion of

is optional. The same would be true for the second sentence of the sequence: <74 TR 251 I dali Total (rāmo nagaram tyajati. tato vanam gacchati-Rāma leaves the city. Then he goes to the forest.) In all of these sentences, then, the verbal ending alone speci fies everything we need to know about the the except its name and gender. Therefore, when that name is provided, it is in the 94141 or nominative (naming) case. In the first sentence if we change the number of the dire, the verbal ending also changes. Thus: yfosal causiai (pandito mūrkhāms tya jati)

: 1 (panditau mūrkhāms tyajataḥ) ausal Raffusil (panditā mūrkhāms tya janti)

9.11

On the other hand, a change in the number of the direct object) makes no difference whatsoever to the verbal ending or the governed by it. In short, then, the for41146 (verb) tells us nothing about the 04 (direct object), not even its objectness. Therefore, everything about the oth its number and its very objectness, must be provided. This is done by the appropriate fariki (accusative) case ending. Such a usage of the finite verb to refer exclusively to the cho is called the di Pil, which means, the verbal usage, pil, with respect to subject). It is similar to the English "active voice," but, as noted above, it must not be confused with the REG ("active" voice).

There is, however, another type of sentence, which differs from the ci per in that the finite verb refers to (or agrees with) the 2" (direct object) instead of the day. This is called the

HOT PIT, or verbal usage with respect to the direct object. Just as in the pain pill, the verbal ending specifies the num ber and person of the कर्तृ, so in the कर्मणि प्रयोग, it varies with the number and person of the 247. In the sentence 49154i (mūrkhās tyajyante-Fools are abandoned), note that the ending -37) (-ante), which specifies the number and person of the 447, and the 9 (ya) sign of the 041OT FRITT, which specifies its objectness, obviate the need for the special object marker (the faritent ending). All that needs to be supplied is the "name" of the object. Therefore, like the one in the doci piri, it is put in the 944 (nominative/naming case). On the other hand, there is now nothing to specify the subjectness of the s must now be shown explicitly by means of the agentive case, the art (instrumental) case. So to complete the transformation of the example at 9.6, the one or the subject of the action of the verbal root 45 (Vtyaj), must be in the I

त्यज्यन्ते पण्डितेन । (murkhās tyajyante paņditena-Fools are abandoned by the wise man.) = (The wise man abandons fools.)

9.14

163

9.15

Note that just as the verb in the orci I takes no account of the number, etc., of the 2017, so in the differ it is indepen dent of the कर्तृ. Examples: मूर्खास्त्यज्यन्ते पण्डितेन । mūrkhās tyajyante panditena

मूर्खास्त्यज्यन्ते पण्डिताभ्याम् । mūrkhās tyajyante paņditābhyām मूर्खास्त्यज्यन्ते पण्डितैः । mūrkhās tyajyante panditaiḥ

42824548 USTA (-318-2114 :-2:) but mūrkhas tyajyate panditena (-ābhyām ; -aih) 9.16 To recapitulate, then, in traditional terminology:

a. In the soci cete (i.e., che in ge41; 2441146 agrees with rel),

the कर्मत्व (objectness) of the कर्मन् is अनभिहित (unspecified)

by the क्रियापद. Therefore, the कर्मन् is in the द्वितीया विभक्ति. b. In the कर्मणि प्रयोग (i.e., कर्मन् in प्रथम; क्रियापद agrees with

कर्मन्), the कर्तृत्व (subjectness) of the कर्तृ is अनभिहित by the

क्रियापद. Therefore, the कर्तृ is in the तृतीया विभक्ति. The Hai (Bhāve Prayoga): Abstract Construction It is clear from the very terminology used to name these con structions thatthe distinction should apply only toसकर्मक धातु-s (transitive verbs)(4.38), i.e., to verbs that can take ofa-s (di rect objects). In fact, however, the freedom and frequency with which the ai ir is used has led to the creation of a parallel construction used with 340. UTG-s (intransitive verbs). This construction, for which English has no real equivalent, is

called the H ear, the abstract construction. 9.18 This construction, a sort of "passive" of intransitive verbs, is

actually a sort of analog to the HTUT IT constructed in the absence of a 4. Since every verb has a che, one can proceed

with the भावे प्रयोग as far as the कर्तृ with no difficulty. The कर्तृ

9.17

The

164

is put into the तृतीया, just as it is in the कर्मणि प्रयोग. But whereas the verbof the कर्मणि प्रयोग agrees with the कर्मन्, in the भावे प्रयोग there is no off with which to make it agree. Here, then, the “कर्मन्” is taken to be the abstract तत् (it or that). Accordingly the verb in a भावे construction must always be प्रथमपुरुष एकवचन.

Examples: The drail sentences: मुनयो वने वसन्ति । munayo vane vasanti. (The sages live in the forest.) and राजानः सुखं जीवन्ति । rājānaḥ sukham jīvanti. (Kings live happily.) could be transformed into the following a sentences: मुनिभिर्वन उष्यते ।

munibhir vana usyate. (See 3.18 for सन्धिब्द) (Literally, “It is lived in the forest by the sages.") and राजभिः सुखं जीव्यते । rājabhiḥ sukham jīvyate. (Literally, “It is lived happily bykings.") To transform a कर्तरि to a कर्मणि प्रयोग sentence: 1. Put the कर्तृ in the तृतीया. 2. Put the कर्मन् in the प्रथमा. 3. Use the कर्मणि form of the verb in agreement with the कर्मन्. Example: रामो राक्षसान्हन्ति । rāmo rākṣasān hanti. (Rāma kills the demons.)

9.19

1. रामः → रामेण । ramah → rāmena 2. राक्षसान् → राक्षसाः | raksasan → raksasah 3. हन्ति → हन्यन्ते । hanti → hanyante

रामेण राक्षसा हन्यन्ते । rāmeņa rākṣasā hanyante. (Rama kills thedemons [lit., the demons are killed by Rama].)

165

9.20

To transform a HT to a pair I simply reverse the above procedure. Example: मया त्वं राजा क्रियसे । mayā tvam rājā kriyase. (You are made king by me.)

reverse 1.41 37641

2. 94 → 9141 2. 7511 → T5161 3. PR → RII

mayā → aham tvam → tvām rājā → rājānam kriyasekaromi

अहं त्वां राजानं करोमि । aham tvām rājānam karomi. (I make you king.)

9.21

The कर्मणि and भावे प्रयोग-s may be formed in the लङ् as well as the E. They are formed just as though from a fourth Tu verb with the prefixed augment. They must of course always have the 3116446 versions of the “secondary endings” (see 8.9). Examples: राक्षसो ऽहन्यत रामेण । rākşaso 'hanyata rāmeņa. (The demon was killed by Rāma.)

नगरमगम्यत राज्ञा । nagaram agamyata rājñā. (The king went to the city.) (Literally: "It was gone to the city by the king.")

9.22

Remember that in transforming a sentence from or to the कर्मणि प्रयोग the only parts of speech that must be changed are the कर्तृ, कमेन, and the क्रियापद. Of course, any adjectives that modify the one and 2 and any nouns or pronouns in apposition with them must remain in agreement or apposition and must then change accordingly. Adverbs and other nouns that are not the

and not in agreement or apposition with them do not change. This latter includes nouns in cases other than the प्रथमा, द्वितीया, and तृतीया. Be careful of words in the तृतीया that are

166

9.23

9.24

not the one in sufor constructions. This case may mark the instrument (201) of an action and may appear to be in agree ment or apposition with the true sted. For example, in the sentence दशरथेन शरेण ब्राह्मणो हन्यते । (dasarathena Sarena brāhmaṇo hanyate—The brāhman is killed with an arrow by Dasaratha), the road is Dasaratha while the arrow is the cul, despite their seeming agreement. The correct that transfor

mation would be: दशरथः शरेण बाह्मणं हन्ति । (dasarathah sarena brāhmaṇam hanti). These constructions, the कर्मणि and भावे प्रयोग-s, are extremely common in Sanskrit but do not always have any special force that sets them apart in meaning from their acil Rit counter parts. When translating into English, then, it is generally ad visable to renderthem into active sentences if the passive sounds awkward or forced. Certainly this should always be done in the case of H9 sentences. The Formation of the auffo reite (karmaṇi prayoga) The formation of this complicated-sounding, but actually rather simple, construction is quite mechanical and is easily leamed. The कर्मणि (and भावे) प्रयोग is not part of the present system. It is formed by two simple steps. a. To the UTC (verbal root), absolutely without reference to

its , is added 7, the fat marker to form the lo stem. b. To this stem are then added the appropriate 3T164246 end

ings. Example: ETTE Dual effor Meaning त्यज् त्यजति त्यज्यते। (he, she, it ...) Ntyaj (1) tyajati tyajyate is abandoned ज्ञा जानाति ज्ञायते Vjñā (9) jānāti jñāyate is known छिद् छिनत्ति छिद्यते

Vchid (7) chinatti chidyate is cut

9.25

167

9.26

Keep two points clearly in mind: a. The य of the कर्मणि प्रयोग is notto be confused with the यof

the fourth 7", even though there are cases where the two forms might be identical. The ti pirt is formed from roots of all 101-s and is not derived from the present

stems. b. Although the कर्मणि प्रयोग always takes the आत्मनेपद end

ings, it is not true that those endings always indicate कर्मणि

प्रयोग. (See 4.16) The following are important exceptions to the basic rule of कर्मणि stem formation: a. Root final इ (i) or 3 (u) is lengthened,

## 10 Nominal Stems in - ऋ; Verbal Adjectives; भूते कृदन्तः

10.0

There is relatively small but important group of nouns whose stems end in the vowel -- (). This group is divisible into two closely similar subgroups with slightly different declensions. Nouns of these declensions are unlike other nouns in final vow els in that they show the system of stem strength typical of consonant final stems. i. The first, and much more restricted, of these subgroups con

sists almost wholly of terms for kinship relations such as: gleg (duhitr) (f) daughter the (pits) (m) father HCL (bhrāts) (m) brother

HTCL (māts) (f) mother ii. The second, and larger, group consists of a series of quasi

adjectival agent nouns formed from many verbal roots by the addition of the suffix - (-tr), similar in meaning to the English agentive suffix -er. This suffix is either added directly to the verbal root or in some cases, is separated from the root by the vowel 5 (i). (See 13.1.a, 16.1.) In either case the root vowel takes ju if possible. Examples: root

agent noun (Vkr) (8P) do

ce(karty) doer, grammatical

subject f (Vji) (1P) win

stę (jetr) winner, victor 74 (Vgam) (1P) go

(gants) goer (Vbhuj) (7P) eat WTEE (bhokty) eater 24 (Vraks) (1P) protect o r (rakṣit;) protector This group also contains two kinship terms: 7 (naptr [m]-grandson) and FCE (svasr [f]—sister).

174

10.1

10.2

Gender of Stems in - (-r) a. The stems of group one (kinship terms) are grensor Files

according to the natural gender of the family member

named. This group contains no nouns of the नपुंसकलिङ्ग. b. The agentive nouns of group two, however, are quasi-ad

jectival in that they may take on the gender of a person or thing with which they are in apposition. When Faircas forms occur the ending - (-tr) is replaced by the ending - (-trī). These forms are then declined regularly accord ing to the paradigm for stems in - $ (ī) given at 7.1. Thus, one has to learn new declensions only for ytes and the less common नपुंसकलिङ्ग. The kinship term स्वसृ (svasr

sister) is, of course, Fritos. Declension of Stems in- (-) a. All stems of group one and yies stems (plus Fox-svasy)

of group two have very similar declensions with only two basic differences: i. Except for the gen 16°, where all these forms show

the ending -371 (-ā), the two groups differ in the strong forms (8.1); nouns of group one showing you of the stem final -37C (-ar), nouns of group two showing area

-3173 (-ār). ii. स्त्रीलिङ्ग nouns of grouponeand the noun स्वसृ (svasr

sister) of group two have as their frien og ending -#: (-th) in contrast to the corresponding ending -727

(ện) for tos nouns of both groups. b. Final - 7 (-1) of ayantes nouns of group two is treated as

regards length) exactly as is the final -3 (-u) of the a ss

nouns in final 3 (-u) (see 6.1.d). Paradigms of - 7 (-r) Stem Nouns a. The following paradigm shows the declension of fre (pitr

father) a typical is noun of group one. In addition the प्रथमा and द्वितीया विभक्ति-s of कर्तृ (kartr doer), a पुंलिङ्ग noun of group two, and of HTĘ (māts—mother) representing a Files noun of group one are given. Their parent through सप्तमी forms will follow the paradigm for पितृ.

Verbal Adjectives: Sanskrit Participles Despite its possession of a rich and complex system of verbal conjugations, or perhaps because of this, Sanskrit shows a marked proclivity for nominalization the substitution of nomi nal forms (सुबन्त-s) for finite verbal forms (तिङन्त-s). This is done through the use of a variety of declinable and indeclin able words, which are derived from the verbal roots. Perhaps the most versatile and useful of these words are the participles (कृदन्त-s). These words are remarkable in that they are adjecti val in form but verbal in function. As a result of this peculiar dual nature it is often possible for one word, formally a simple

177

adjective, to replace virtually an entire clause. Beginning stu dents are particularly fond of these forms as, through their use, they are frequently able to substitute an easily declinable adjective for a possibly obscure and almost certainly forgot ten finite verb. Participles, like any nominal forms, may be negated by the prefixing of -37 or before initial vowels, -371 (see 6.21). Example:

(vśru) (5P) hear a (śruta) heard

Pra (aśruta) unheard

10.5

10.6

R (Bhūte Krdanta): Past-passive Participle Now that the shit has been introduced, it is advisable to learn, in conjunction with it, the so-called past-passive parti ciple of Sanskrit. This participle is very common and useful. It is formed from virtually any , or verbal root, and de pending mainly on the transitivity of the root, has two basic applications. a. From Hash (transitive) roots, it forms adjectives that indi

cate that the nouns that they modify are the 24-s (direct objects) of the action expressed by the ET, or verbal root. Such a verbal adjective, agreeing (here as regards case, number, and gender) with the of its root, is of course a nominalization of the cito pirt. As such, its subject, if expressed, must be in the aire fauft. Examples:

राक्षसो हतो रामेण । Vhan (2P) (kill) rākşaso hato rāmeņa.

(The demon is (was) killed by Rāma.)

हन्

पठ् Vpath (1P) (read)

तत्पुस्तकं न मया पठितम् । tat pustakam na mayā pațhitam. (That book is (was) not read by me.) (I didn't read the book.)

178

तानि पुस्तकान्यपठितानि । tāni pustakāny aparhitāni. (Those books have not been read.) त्यक्तां कन्यां पश्यामि । tyaktām kanyām paśyāmi. (I see the abandoned girl.)

त्यज

Ntyaj (1P) (abandon);

छिद्

Vchid (7P) (cut)

किं नश्छिन्नम् । kim naś chinnam? (What of ours is cut? [i.e., What's it to me?])

Note that the action expressed by this usage of the

a is not necessarily "past." Rather one might say that it is "perfective" in that it is completed and not still in process regardless of the tense of the clause in which it

appears. b. From 37274 (intransitive) UTC -s, or verbal roots, it

forms adjectives that indicate that the nouns modified are the e-s (subjects) of the action of the Ung, verbal root. This action is frequently in the past. In other words, the participle serves as a nominalization of a simple past tense

(e.g., 5.) in the chair in Examples: i. This usage is especially common with verbs of motion,

which, although they have their locus of motion in the द्वितीया विभक्ति (see 4.38,41), are treated as अकर्मक धातु-s (intransitive roots).

रामो वनं गतः । सीतापि तत्र गता । Vgam (1P) (go) rāmo vanam gataḥ. (Rāma

went to the forest.) sītāpi tatra gatā. (Sītā also went there.)

गम्

311 + 91 ā + Vyā (2P) (come)

अहमप्यायातः । aham apy āyātaḥ. (I also came.)179

ii. From other 37931 roots the participle may be an ad

jective with no particular reference to time.

स्था

बहवो मुनयो वने स्थिताः । Vsthā (1P) (stand) bahavo munayo vane sthitā).

(Many sages are standing (located) in the forest.)

कुप् Vkup (4P) (be angry)

अतीव कुपितौ तौ द्वौ मुनी । atīva kupitau tau dvau munī. (The two muni-s are extremely angry.)

Vmț (6Ā) (die)

सर्वे वीरा मृताः । sarve vīrā mrtāḥ. (All the heroes are dead.)

जन्

Njan (4Ā) (be born)

त्वं कुत्र जातः । tvam kutra jātaḥ. (Where were you born?)

NY

By extension, such adjectives may come to be used as nouns in their own right. Examples:

बुद्ध । बुद्धस्य नाम गौतम इति । Vbudh (1P) (be

buddha (enlightened); enlightened)

buddhasya nāma gautama iti. (The Buddha's name was Gautama.)

वृध

Vvrdh (1Ā) (grow)

TE I TEGI flaga vsddha (fully grown, old); vệddhā kim avadat. (What did the old woman say?)

180

10.7

The formation of this useful participle is generally quite simple. The participle is invariably an -37 stem adjective. It is usually formed by the suffixation of the syllable - directly to the धातु, or verbal root. a. The root normally shows no strength.

किं त्वया कृतम् । Vkr (8)

kim tvaya krtam. (What have you done?)

Viru (5)

एवं मया श्रुतम् । evam mayā śrutam. (Thus have I heard.)

वि + स्मृ vi + Vsmr (1)

अद्यापि सा न मया विस्मृता । adyāpi sā na mayā vismrtā. (Even today, I don't forget her.)

अभि + भू abhi + vbhū (1)

शिवः कथमभिभूतः पार्वत्या । śivah katham abhibhūtaḥ pārvatyā. (How was Siva overcome by Parvati?)

b. If the root has a weaker form, the suffix is added to that

(cf.7.1.5.a). Examples:

दशति

दष्ट Vdams (1) dasati (bite) dasta (bitten)7.18.c

दंश

बन्ध

बध्नाति

बद्ध Vbandh (9) badhnāti (bind) baddha (bound)

This applies also to those roots which are weakened in the कर्मणि प्रयोग (9.27.d).

Examples:

इष्ट Vyaj(1) (sacrifice) ista (sacrificed)

य

181

वच

उक्त ukta (spoken, said)

vvac (2) (speak)

NOTE: The extremely common root va is especially common in 10 forms, an

न्त, उक्त, may refer either to something that was said or to a person addressed. This is often confusing. A good clue is that when the former is meant (something said), it is usually in the 794455 whereas a person addressed will require the participle to be in the gender proper to that person (gless, Fifs). Examples: यत्त्वयोक्तं तदसत्यमेव । yat tvayoktam, tad asatyam eva. (What you said, is surely false.)

एवमुक्ता राक्षसेन सीता भीताभवत् । evam uktā rākşasena sītā bhītābhavat. (Addressed thus by the demon, Sītā became frightened.)

c. A group of roots, some of them very common, ending in

nasals, lose the final nasal before the ending - Examples:

1H (Vgam) (1) go

Ta (gata) went 44 (Vyam) (1) restrain ya (yata) restrained 74 (Vnam) (1) bend, bow Ta (nata) bent <H (Vram) (1) delight, be a (rata) delighted

content & (Vhan) (2) kill 66 (hata) killed The following sound changes should be learned: a. In general, root final -371 or complex vowels become -

before the ending -A. Examples: 4 (Vpā) (1) drink

1a (pita) drunk (Vgai) (1) sing

afta (gita) sung; गीता (gitā) song

b.

But, the following important exceptions must be memo rized: i. Ti (Viña) (9) know if (jñāta) known ii. Fell (Vsthā) (1) stand fra (sthita) stood iii. a (1dā) (3) give GF (datta) given iv. UT (Vdhā) (3) place foa (hita) placed A root final voiced aspirate is deaspirated before 7, and the ais voiced and aspirated. (7.26.b) Examples:

4 (Vbudh) (1) awaken + a (ta) → 96 (buddha)

awakened FI (Vkşubh) (4) shake + a (ta) → gol (kșubdha)

shaken (vlabh) (1) obtain +a (ta) → ou (labdha)

obtained

d.

C. The roots CE (1) (Vdah—burn) and GE (2) (Vduh—milk)

are treated as if they were Ge (dagh) and 54 (dugh) re spectively, and the root F (4) (Vnah-bind) as if it were 74 (nadh). GE (Vdah) burn + a (ta) → GU (dagdha) burned

€ (duh) milk +a (ta) → Ghu (dugdha) milked TE (Vnah) bind + a (ta) → 76 (naddha) bound Several other roots with final are treated peculiarly: The root final before -a becomes and the is lost. A preceding or 3 vowel is lengthened. In the roots HE (1) (Vsah-endure, bear), and 16 (1) (Vvah-carry), the 37 vowel becomes 371. (See 20.6.i.) Examples: fase (Vlih) (2) lick → m (līdha) licked

E (Vruh) (1) climb, mount → 56 (rūdha) climbed,

mounted HE (Vsah) (1) endure → HC (sodha) endured TE (Vvah) (1) carry → ale (vodha) carried

183

e. See 7.18.e and 34.b for the treatment of the aloog root

finals and 3 before-a. Note also the change of 7 to after (7.18.b). 7 before or everywhere becomes Examples: y (Vyuj) (7) join F (yukta) joined fan (Ndvis) (2) hate → førse (dvişța) hated C (Ndré) see →

See (drsta) seen

10.9

Certain roots are set off from the - ending by the vowel 5. There is no comprehensive set of rules covering all cases of this use of 5. There are, however, certain root finals which generally require it. a. Root final conjuncts.

Examples: Parc (Wnind) (1) blame → Arca (nindita) blamed gra (Vcumb) (1) kiss → gfaa (cumbita) kissed

(vśañk) (1) doubt → iga (sañkita) doubted

b. Root final UR consonants.

Examples: 48 (Vpath) (1) read → od (pathita) read 494 (Vbhāş) (1) speak — WIE (bhāșita) spoken at (Vvas) (1) → (34uş) ► 31 (ușita) dwelt

dwell

c. Root final (1) or (v).

Examples: as (Vcal) (1) move → sita (Njiv) (1) live → Ha (Vsev) (1) serve →

efca (calita) moved sillata (jivita) lived, enlivened Naa (sevita) served

d. Root final nonvoiced aspirates.

Examples: free (Vlikh) (6) write → Praa (likhita) written

184

All 10th 14 roots take 5, which is added to the strength ened stem. fan (Vcint) (10) think → Papera (cintita) thought

(Vcur) (10) steal alia (corita) stolen

10.10 Many other finals may require $. These should simply be

learned as they are encountered. The following are important examples:

(Vpar) (1) fall → upda (patita) fallen C (Vkhād) (1) eat → CUCI (khādita) eaten 4 (Vkup) (4) be angry → Satua (kupita) angry 4 (Vbādh) (1) oppress → alta (bādhita) oppressed

10.11

10.12

The root T (9P) (Vgrah-take hold of) inserts $ before the ending. The correct form, then, is Tata (gshita—taken). A few roots form the EGR with the suffix -7. The largest class of these are roots ending inc. The before the 7 of the ending is peculiar in that it assimilates completely and be comes 7. Examples:

FOG (Ichid) (7) cut → Pes (chinna) cut

PTG (Vbhid) (7) split → (bhinna) separated, split

· (Vpad) (4) move → 45 (panna) moved There are other roots which take this ending and which are simply learned as encountered. Examples:

(Vp7) (9) fill →

pūrņa) full, filled (Vin) (4) waste away → stof (jirņa) wasted, aged (Vli) (4) cling →

लीन (lina)attached ET (Whā) (3) abandon → ta (hina) abandoned

## 11 Stems in -अन्त; Adjectival Suffixes in-मन्त् and -वन्तः The क्तवतु (Past Active Participle); । The त्वान्त, ल्यबन्त (Gerund); The लोट् (Imperative)

11.0

11.1

Stems in -376 There are a number of nominal and adjectival stems in Sanskrit that end in the vowel 37 followed by the conjunct - These words fall into a very few fairly significant categories.

1. Adjectives formed with the possessive suffixes -Hal and

-वन्त् (traditionally called मतुप् and वतुप respectively by the

grammarians). 2. The वर्तमाने कृदन्त (present participle). See Lesson 15. 3. A small number of anomalous forms which appear to have

belonged originally to 1 or 2. The following paradigms are for stems belonging to 1 and 3 above. The present participles (2), whose paradigm differs slightly, will be treated separately (Lesson 15).. a. पुंलिङ्ग । भगवन्त् (blessed) एक०

बहु भगवान् भगवन्तौ भगवन्तः भगवन्तम् भगवन्तौ भगवतः भगवता भगवट्याम् भगवद्भिः भगवते भगवद्भ्याम् भगवद्यः भगवतः

भगवद्याम्

भगवद्भ्यः भगवतः भगवतोः

भगवताम् भगवति भगवतोः भगवत्सु सम् भगवन् भगवन्तौ भगवन्तः

192

b. As usual, the नपुंसकलिङ्ग differs from the पुंलिङ्ग only in the

प्रथमा and द्वितीया. नपुंसकलिङ्ग । भगवन्त (blessed)

बहु भगवत् भगवती भगवन्ति

भगवत् भगवती भगवन्ति सम्° भगवत् भगवती भगवन्ति

एक

Note that stem strength and weakness is shown by the pres ence or absence of the stem nasal 7 (see 8.1). The Fill, or feminine, of the stems is formed by adding ई to the weak stem (-अत्) and is then declined like any noun of that stem final (see 7.1). Example: भगवती (blessed lady)

11.2

There are two stems that end in -अन्त् ,which are very useful and should be learned. a. The important adjective 46 (large, great) is declined like

the above, but its stem vowel 37 is long (371) in all the strong forms. Examples: महानृषिर्दृश्यते न दृश्यते वा कलौ युगे । (Does a great rsi appear or not in the kali age?)

राक्षसा महान्तौ वीरौ न कदापि घ्नन्ति ।

(The rāksasa-s never kill the two great heroes.) b. The word भवन्त् (स्त्रीलिङ्ग–भवती), perhaps a shortened form

ofभगवन्त,is regularly used as a polite or respectfulequiva lent of the 4434449 pronoun. It construes with the verb in the प्रथमपुरुष and may be used in the बहुवचन to show still

greater respect Examples: भवान्कस्माद् देशादागतवान् । (From what country have you come?) (See 11.4)

193

भवन्तः कुत्र वसन्ति । (Where do you live?)

यद्भवत्या कृतं तन्मह्यमतीव रोचते । (What you (my lady) have done pleases me very much.)

तत्कथं ज्ञातं भवद्भिः । (How do you know this?)

11.3

The Adjectival Suffixes - and del The most common forms of this type are adjectives made by suffixation of the possessive affix -मन्त् (मतुप) to the stem form of most nouns. Examples:

(intelligence) बुद्धिमन्त् (wise) Hla: (f) (memory, sacred स्मृतिमन्त् (possessed of

knowledge)

memory) T: (n) (bow)

44* (having a bow) (m)

(archer) 48 (n) (honey)

मधुमन्त् (sweet) रामो बुद्धिमान्स्मृतिमानित्युक्तं रामायणे । (It is said in the Rāmāyana that Rāma is wise and possessed of memory.)

The suffix-R is changed to or when: 1. The stem ends in a 4 or an 31 or 311, or if any one of the

proceeding occurs as the penultimate. Examples: faen (f) (knowledge) felldar (possessed of knowledge) Get (f) (fortune) FHCR (possessed of fortune)

RIE (n) (fame) यशस्वन्त् (famous) 2. The stem originally ends in a 42.

Example: TEC (n) (lightning) विधुत्वन्त् (possessed of lightning)

194

NOTE: The stem to which the - Alor -suffix is added is not considered word final. Therefore, the addition of these affixes do not require external सन्धि . The 2699 (Past Active Participle) Such possessive usages are fairly limited. However, the suf fixation of ont (fieradi) to a T or, whether its verbal root is सकर्मक or अकर्मक, yields a useful and common verbal adjective modifying the day, which functions as yet another simple past tense in the air reti. Examples: V774 (go) I 74 Than I Hang Traditi (Rāma went to the forest. Sītā went too.)

VH8 (10P) (eat); vaq (2P) (say) नाहं भक्षितवानम्बेत्युक्तवाञ्छीकृष्णो भागवते । (“I didn't eat [it] mummy," so said Srikssna in the Bhāgavata Purāņa.)

11.5

The त्वान्त/ल्यबन्त (Gerund) The gerund, or indeclinable participle in-call or -7, is one of the most frequently encountered and useful items in the lan guage. The gerund is used, often profusely, to mark successive dependent clauses, the actions of which are meant to be prior to, or, in some cases, simultaneous with, the action of an inde pendent clause. In most cases the of the dependent clause is the same as that of the independent clause. In this way, a complex sentence may have only one finite verb or its syntac tic equivalent Examples: पौत्रान्दृष्ट्वा कुटुम्बं परित्यज्य वनं गत्वा वृक्षस्य समीप उपविश्येन्द्रियाणि विजित्य परमं ध्यात्वा च मोक्षं लभते मनुष्यः । (Having seen his grandchildren, having left his family, having gone to the forest, having sat down near a tree, having sub dued his senses, and having meditated on the highest, a man obtains liberation.)

195

कपेस्तद्वचनं श्रुत्वा सीता सुखिताभवत् । (Having heard the monkey's speech, Sītā became happy.)

उक्त्वा भुक्त्वा गता गृहम् । (Having talked and eaten, she went home.)

11.6

Since itis always an अव्ययपद (indeclinable) the त्वान्त or ल्यबन्त is not subject to agreement of any kind with कर्तृ ,कर्मन् , or any thing else. Because of this it may be used freely in both sidik and if clauses with reference generally to the tree regard less of its case. Example: रामेण तत्र गत्वा सर्वे राक्षसा हताः । (Rāma, having gone there, killed all the rākṣasa-s.)

11.7

The CalR/Cyant is formed in different ways, depending upon whether the verbal root is preceded by an 3441-1. (See 8.12.) a. i. If there is no 34771, the suffix -rall is added directly to a

weak form of the root, in general the same form which precedes the - of the Ye EGR. (See 10.7-9.) These forms are called Calle Examples: Vory (12)

Taal (having gone) VE (2) ► Oral (having slain) VET (4P)

(having seen) Vol (SP)

al (having heard) Vवच् (2P) 3964| (having said) Vत्यज् (1P)

त्यक्त्वा (having abandoned) (8P)

al (having done) स्था (1P) स्थित्वा (having stood) 191 (1P)

tical (having drunk) (3P)

Grall (having given) (3P)

focal (having placed)

voce

VET

196

ii. A number of roots require the insertion of the vowel 3

before the ending. Others take the vowel optionally. The root VTE (9P) (Talla) requires the vowel $ (cf. 10.9-11). Examples: Van (1P) → 379cal (having dwelt) viac (2) fleral (having known) VJE (9P) → Tetrall (having taken)

iii. Roots of the tenth 1 (7.38) require that the ending

-roll, which must be preceded by the vowel 5, replace the final 37 of the present stem. Example: VaR (10P)Parafical (having thought)

b. Roots preceded by 34421-s form the gerund in two ways,

depending upon whether or not the root ends in a short vowel. These forms are called S R . i. If the root does not end in a short vowel (by far the

most common case), the car is formed by adding the suffix - directly to the root. Before this suffix (and the suffix -27; see ii below) the roots generally take the weakened forms appropriate before the -of the भूते कृगन्त. (See 10.7-9.) Examples: परि + Vत्य

परित्यज्य (having abandoned) 311 + Von → 311154 (having come) 37+ VET

315k (having permitted)

ii. If a root ends in a short vowel and is preceded by an

उपसर्ग the suffix is -त्य. Examples: fa + VFG

विजित्य (having abandoned) 37] + Vēs

अनुकृत्य (having imitated) 9 + V5

प्रेत्य (having died)

Î Î

197

11.8

Note that some roots in -अम् or -अन् that form weakened past भूते कृदन्त-s (गम् → गत; हन् → हत) (see 10.7.c) are sometimes treated as short अ stems after उपसर्ग-s. So, आ + गम् may form

आगम्य or आगत्य (having come), while नि + हन् always forms निहत्य (having killed).

11.9

The लोट् (Imperative) The Ic is the mode of instruction or command. Since it oc curs most commonly in direct address, मध्यम पुरुष forms are the most frequently used, although for various reasons, includ ing politeness, theप्रथम पुरुष forms are also quite common. The TC has no mode-sign of its own and simply adds its own distinctive endings to the present stems of the various roots. The scheme of personal endings is as follows:

11.10

11.11

परस्मैपद एक द्वि प्र° तु ताम् म० ०/धि/हि तम् उ० आनि आव

बहु | एक अन्तु/अतु | ताम् त |स्व

आत्मनेपद द्वि० बहु

आताम् अन्ताम/अताम् आथाम् ध्वम् आवहै आमहै

आम

11.12 मध्यम पुरुष Endings:

a. The मध्यम एक परस्मैपद ending for roots of the 'अ' गण-s

(1,4,6,10) is 0 (zero). In other words, this most important लोट् form, is identical with the present stem. Examples: Vभू (1P) (be) हे शकुन्तले भर्तुर्बहुमता भव । (o Sakuntala, be well respected by your husband!)

स्था (1P) (stay); Vगम् (1P) (go) राम नगरे मा तिष्ठ वनमेव गच्छ । (Rama! Don't stay in the city, go to the forest.)

198

4R + Vas (1P) (wander) वने परिव्रजेति श्रुत्वा परिवाजको भवत् । (Having heard, "wander in the forest," he became a wan dering mendicant.)

145 (1P) (worship) भज गोविन्दं भज गोविन्दं गोविन्दं भज मूढमते । (Worship Govinda (Krsna), Worship Govinda, Worship Govinda, O you fool!)

b.

The non-37 10-8 (2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9) have, for this form, the endings -TE or 199, depending upon whether the verbal stem ends in a vowel or a consonant. Note that this particular form is unusual in that for the non-37 791-s it is made from the weak form of the stem, even in those 1-s that require root strength in all other 550 REY forms. Examples:

लोट V5 (2) fa spa (go!) VGE (2) alfa Ti GA 94 (Milk the cow for milk!) va (2) Taifa

(Speak! Speak, friend!)

लट्

c. Some roots of the third ( 1 present irregularities.

i. The root va itself violates rule b., in that it takes the

ending-, despite the fact that its stem ends in a vowel. Example:

E offer!)

ii. Far more important are the two common roots Val and

VET. Here they form SR (give) and ul (place). Example:

HSR GRETA (Give (me) food, O King!) d. Since all roots of the seventh (D end in consonants

and the 101 sign precedes the final consonant, all the present199

stems of the 14 likewise end in consonants. Therefore, the मध्यम° एक परस्मैपद ending in the लोट् of roots of this

गण is always -धि. Example: Vyslu, "yoke!"

e.

Roots of the fifth and eighth ( and - 1-s take the ending - when the root itself ends in a consonant. Example: V3114 I 89415 (Attain happiness!)

But, when the roots end in vowels, this form is identi cal with the weak stem itself. Examples: Vops (8P) affiti degno dia (Do what your father says, my dear boy!)

VI (5P) Tidad 1 (Hear the words of the guru.) 9th | roots ending in vowels take -TE, but those ending in consonants lose their class sign and take the special end ing -316. Example: VTE I JEMY "take"

11.13 The मध्यम° एक° आत्मनेपद is formed by adding the ending -स्व

to the present stem in all cases. Examples: VIY (47) Jezai (fight!) V24 (1Ā) 4469 Hi Gai (Forgive me, O God.)

3114 (2Ā) 3140 I (sit!)

11.14

After 4274° 55° forms, the most important are the gero 550 a. The E14 adds - to present stems. The non-37 701-

show normal strength.

200

Examples:

गम् । रामो वनं गच्छतु । (Let Rāma go to the forest.)

कृ। भरतो राज्यं करोतु । (Let Bharata rule the kingdom.)

b. This form is very frequently used, especially in dramas as

a polite or respectful equivalent of the 924°. Examples:

जि (1P) जयत्वार्यः । (May my lord [i.e., "you"] be victorious.)

प्र + /विश् प्रविशत्वार्यः ।

(Please enter, my lord.)

c. This form of the roots Vअस् (2P) (be), and Vभू (1P) (be)

(अस्तु, भवतु) is often used in the senses, "Okay.," "very well," "Let it be," etc.

11.15

The प्रथम , बहु', परस्मैपद ending -अन्तु behaves exactly like the indicative ending -31 in that it causes the loss of the -37 of an अ गण stem and loses its nasal after stems of the third गण. (See 7.25.) Examples:

पश् (4P) सर्वे भद्राणि पश्यन्तु । (May everyone see auspicious things.)

Vतृ (1P) सर्वे दुर्गाणि तरन्तु । (May everyone overcome difficulties.)

Vदा (3P) ब्राह्मणेभ्यो धनं ददतु । (Let them give wealth to the brāhmans.)

Vभी (3P) न कस्मादपि बिभ्यतु । (Let them fear nothing at all.)

201

11.16 The कर्मणि प्रयोग of the लोट् :

The लोट् may be used in the कर्मणि and भावे प्रयोग-s as well as in the कर्तरि प्रयोग. It is formed, like the कर्मणि प्रयोग of the लट् , by the addition of the appropriate आत्मनेपद लोट् ending to the कर्मणि

stem. (See 9.24-27.) 11.17 This form functions as a very formal or polite imperative and

is very freely used in conversation. In actual use, the तृतीया here usually त्वया, भवता, or भवद्भिः, “byyou") is gener ally unexpressed, and the 47 (in the 74111) is frequently (necessarily in the H RT) (see 9.17) not made explicit. Examples: Va (2P) 3724114

Lit.,"Let it be spoken (by you)."

"Please speak."

Viesca (6P) foscoually

Lit., "Let it be written (by you)."

"Please write (it)."

V3114 (2Ā) 31144214

Lit., “Let it be sat (by you).”

"Please sit down.”

31V-TA (1P) 42 HER PATH

Lit., “Let it be come (by you)

with me.” = “Please come with me.”

अलंकृ (8P) आसनम् अलंक्रियताम् Lit.,"Let the seat be adorned (by

you).”=“Please sit down.”

V&H (1Ā) Rani 959: Lit., “Let this person be

pardoned." ="Pardon me." (For 3144, see 19.1)

11.18 Note that the negative particle 41 is used instead of 7 to negate

लोट forms. Examples:

PRI TEBI (Don't go to the city.) dhe i (Don't do that.)

## 12 Nominal Stems in इन्; समास (Nominal Composition)

12.0

The suffix -5 is used freely in Sanskrit to form adjectives or nouns that indicate that the thing denoted by the word to which the suffix is added is possessed by, or in some way an attribute of, the word that the newly formed adjective modifies. a. The suffix is normally used with noun stems in -31 or -371

and replaces the final vowel. Examples: हस्तः (hand) + इन् →हस्तिन् (possessing a "hand"=elephant)

योगः (yoga) + इन् → योगिन् (yogi) b. A number of stems in-37C form a similar adjective by the

suffixation of fal, which is added to the stem.

Examples: तपः (asceticism) + विन् → तपस्विन् (ascetic)

मनः (mind) + विन् → मनस्विन् (wise) c. These forms are all पुंलिङ्ग or नुपंसकलिङ्ग, as the context re

quires. The corresponding Fifa 15-s are formed with the suffixes -- it and facil and are then declined according to the -ई paradigm (7.1). Examples: योगिनी (female yogi)

तपस्विनी (female ascetic, awretched woman) The declension of the पुंलिङ्ग and नपुंसकलिङ्ग forms is as follows: a. पुंलिङ्ग; योगिन् (yogi) विभक्ति एक

बह योगी

योगिनौ योगिनः द्वि० योगिनम् योगिनौ योगिनः

योगिना

योगिभ्याम्

योगिभिः योगिने योगिभ्याम् योगिभ्यः योगिनः

योगिभ्याम्

योगिभ्यः

12.1.

द्वि०

प्र०

च०

208

योगिनः

योगिनाम् योगिषु योगिनः

योगिनोः स० योगिनि योगिनोः सम् योगिन् योगिनी

b. नपुंसकलिङ्ग; रूपिन् (possessed of form) प्र रूपि

रूपीणि द्वि० रूपि

रूपिणी

रूपीणि सम्० रूपि

रूपिणी

रूपीणि

रूपिणी

The remainder of the declension is the same as the पुंलिङ्ग.

12.2

This paradigm is quite regular. The only point that should be stressed and watched for is that the प्रथमा एक पुंलिङ्ग ends in ई Do not on this account confuse these forms with those of the -इor-ई declensions. This confusion is best avoided, as with the other consonant stems, by memorizing the stem form as

well as the प्रथमा. Example: योगिन् → योगी

12.3

समास: Nominal Composition Now that you have learned most of the major nominal declen sions in all their confusing variety of stems and endings, we come to a feature of Sanskrit that almost makes one wonder why one ever had to learn all this. The feature is 4471, nomi nal compounding, and is one of the most significant and distinctive characteristics of the classical language. It is the variety of nominal compounds that lends to classical Sanskrit much of its characteristic density, terseness, sonorousness, subtlety, and power. There is nothing about the formation of most Sanskrit H4TH-S that should present any great difficulty to a speaker of English. What sets Sanskrit compounds off from those of English and similar languages is the great freedom allowed in compound formation and in literary and scientific texts, the extraordinary

12.4209

12.5

12.6

number of words that may be brought together into a single compound. Nominal compounding is a technique whereby nouns may be related to one another without need for the conventional mark ers of syntactic relation (i.e., the nominal case-endings). Thus composition normally entails (loss) of 64-s (case-endings). Now, as mentioned above (4.44), it is precisely the presence of these 14-s, specifiers of syntactic relations, that makes word order a matter of considerably less significance than it is in

English. Therefore, if the 4-s are lost, one would expect that some other factor, such as fixed word order, would be required to prevent confusion. This is exactly the case in HHTH when ever there is a syntactic relation or some degree of subordination between two nouns. Except for one type of H418 (see Lesson 14), then, word order is rigidly fixed in the formation of H418-s. Word Order in #418- The word order is always the same. The principal noun (or adjective), i.e., the one which itself does not modify, and is not subordinated to any other word in the compound (or potential compound), is always placed last, with the immediately sub ordinated word preceding it. A few examples from English may serve to clarify this. In the compound "bluebird" (as sume for a moment that it refers to any blue bird), it is clearly the word bird that is principal and the modifier blue that is secondary. Therefore, in the sentence, “He sees the bluebird," bird serves as the direct object of the verb sees; it is directly related to something outside the compound. Blue merely speci fies something about bird. In the same way, in the sentence, “I took the horsecart," it is cart and not horse that is the direct object of take. If we reverse the order of the members of the compound, as in, “I took the carthorse," we have a completely

210

12.7

different sentence. In the first, horse is subordinated to cart and serves merely to specify a kind of cart. In the second, cart specifies a kind of horse. Thus, in both sentences only the final member has any reference outside the compound. This is the general rule in Sanskrit with respect to the two most im portant kinds of compounds.

Analysis of समास-s Analysis of compounds in Sanskrit, then, proceeds from the last member back to the first by a series of word-pairs. The technique is to establish the relation of the final member to the preceding member, and next, regarding the last pair as a single unit, to determine its relationship to the preceding member; and then to consider the relationship between the final triplet and the preceding member, and so on. Thus, the great length of some compounds should not be a cause for alarm. No com pound relation refers to more than two words. The following diagrams will illustrate how this is done. Each roman letter indicates one compound relation. Examples: 5779f agulgo (n) (See 12.14.) (Water sanctified by the bath of the daughter of Janaka.) 5114 - TR - FH - you – 36074 janaka — daughter — bath - holy – water

114 – 4 – RR-467 - - - - cowgirl-swelling-breast-kneading-trembling-hand-pair-having

12.8

Techniques of Compounding In almost all types of H418, there is g, or loss of the case number ending, in all members except the last. The last member relates to things outside the HTH and is treated in gen eral as though it were uncompounded. Prior members of HH1H-s usually appear in their stem forms or in some alteration of these stem forms and do not show any change for number or case. Example: देवमित्रम् (=देवस्य मित्रम्) (The friend of god)

If we assume that the unspecified case-relation here is 9501 (genitive), the समास could equally well stand for देवस्य मित्रम्, देवयोर्मित्रम्, or देवानां मित्रम् (the friend of the god, two gods, or gods). Despite the 802, or loss of the case-number ending, the word ca has not lost its power (Plt) to express syntactic rela tion and number. However, here, as with most composition, we must rely on the context to determine what the lost ending was.

212

12.9

12.10

Types of समास-s There are several types of HHIH-s in Sanskrit. These are distin guished according to their foue, 'analysis,' which enables us to "dissolve" the compounds or paraphrase them by restoring what has been lost in composition. The two most important types of समास-s for the beginning stu dent to master are called कर्मधारय and तत्पुरुष. a. The कर्मधारय समास is extremely common. Its formation

and Tour (analysis) are extremely simple. i. In its most common form, it is composed simply of a

noun (or nominal item) to which is prefixed a modify ing adjective in its stem form. Hu at all compound junctures is extemal. Examples: समास

Meaning

विग्रह तुङ्गवृक्षः tall tree

तुङ्गो वृक्षः सुन्दरमृगः beautiful deer सुन्दरो मुगः प्रियमित्रम् dear friend

प्रिय मित्रम् हतराक्षसाः slain raksasa-s हता राक्षसाः त्यक्तभार्या abandoned wife त्यक्ता भार्या वृद्धतपस्विनी aged ascetic woman वृद्धा तपस्विनी अभिज्ञातशूरी two recognized heroes 371 Notice that the noun modified is in no way altered. It retains its usual gender and proper number and is used exactly like an uncompounded noun. Examples: तुङ्गवृक्षे वसन्ति बहुशुकाः । (तुङ्गे वृक्षे वसन्ति बहवः शुकाः ।) (Many parrots live in the tall tree.) मृतराक्षसेषु तिष्ठति रामः । (मृतेषु राक्षसेषु ...) (Rāma stands amidst the dead rākṣasa-s.)

b.

Aless common butstill frequently occurring kind ofकर्मधारय HHIH is that in which one noun is equated with another.

213

राजर्षि

Here again it is the prior member, which is subordinate, that “qualifies" the latter. Examples: समास

विग्रह

Meaning वाग्द्वारम् वाग् द्वारम् (speech-door)

a doorway which is of the

form of a speech सागरमेखला सागरो मेखला

(ocean-girdle) a girdle which is the

ocean राजा ऋषिः (king-sage, a royal sage) नरसिंहः नरः सिंहः. (man-lion) In this type of HRH, which is called the appositional or equational कर्मधारय, the two elements, being nouns, retain their inherent genders, just as when any two nouns are equated. Thus, in the compound वाग्द्वारम्, वाग्isस्त्रीलिङ्ग while

द्वारम् is नपुंसकलिङ्ग. 12.11 समानाधिकरण : Case Agreement

In either of the two types of कर्मधारय समास, the members, when subjected to four must be in the same case. This is because these members, whether their relationship is that of adjective and noun or of apposition, always stand in the same grammati cal relationship to a verb or other part of speech. Thus, for example in the sentence: दशरथो महान् राजा महान्तं हस्तिनं महति वने हन्ति । (The great King Dasaratha kills the great elephant in the great forest.)

a. दशरथः, महान् and राजा arein apposition and so must be in the

same case (प्रथमा) as कर्तृ of Vहन्. b. महान्तम् modifies हस्तिनम् , which is the कर्मन् of Vहन्, so they

must agree. c. महति modifies वने, the अधिकरण (locus) of the action of Vहन,

so they too must agree.

214

land

The sentence could be rewritten using कर्मधारय समास-s each one including a group of words in agreement: दशरथमहाराजो महाहस्तिनं महावने हन्ति । The Sanskrit term for this kind of equal governance of several words by a verb, etc., is called समानाधिकरण. This is not to be confused with the apparent agreement such as we saw in the sentence of the type: रामेण शरेण राक्षसो हन्यते । (Rāma kills the rākşasa with an arrow.) in which there is no समानाधिकरण relating रामेण, the कर्तृ, and शरेण, the करण (instrument), of the action of Vहन्. A कर्मधारय समास then, is one whose members are governed by the relationship

of समानाधिकरण. 12.12 The तत्पुरुष समास : Syntactic Compound

The other major compound type which must be mastered thor oughly is the so-called you, or syntactic compound. The तत्पुरुष contrasts sharply with the कमेधारय in that, as appears when subjected to fue, there must not be case agreement (समानाधिकरण) between the two members. If in विग्रह, the last member is cited in its en form, the prior member will be in any other case. The day may then be identified by the num ber of the case of the prior member. In fact, the षष्ठी and तृतीया are, in that order, the most common types of तत्पुरुष.

षष्ठी राक्षस

Type समास

विग्रह Meaning षष्ठी देवपुत्रः (m) देवस्य पुत्रः son of the god षष्ठी रामदूतः (m) रामस्य दूतः Rama's messenger

राक्षसकन्या (1) राक्षसस्य कन्या daughter of the raksasa षष्ठी सीतापुस्तकम् (n) सीतायाः पुस्तकम् Sita's book षष्ठी नरोत्तमः (m) नराणामुत्तमः best of men तृतीया निद्राबाधित (adj) निद्रया बाधित oppressed by sleep तृतीया नृपहत (adj) नृपेण हत s lain by the king पञ्चमी मरणभयम् (n) मरणाद्भयम् fear of death

215

सप्तमी वनवासः (m) वने वासः dwelling in the forest सप्तमी जलक्रीडा (1) जले क्रीडा sport in the water चतुर्थी पादोदकम् (n) पादाभ्यामुदकम् water for the feet द्वितीया स्वर्गगमनम् (n) स्वर्गं प्रति गमनम् going to heaven

12.13 Notes on the formation of तत्पुरुष and कर्मधारय समास-s

a. कर्मधारयor तत्पुरुष समास-s may either be nouns or adjectives,

as their final members are nouns or adjectives. Examples:

समास विग्रह (तृतीया तत्पुरुष) नृपोक्त नृपेणोक्त (adj) spoken by the king (षष्ठी तत्पुरुष) नृपवचनम् नृपस्य वचनम् (n) the speech of the

king

(कर्मधारय) (कर्मधारय)

तुङ्गवृक्षः तुङ्गो वृक्षः (n) the tall tree वृक्षतुङ्ग वृक्ष इव तुङ्ग (adj) tall as a tree

In fact, however, the placement of certain types of adjec tives in a HHR can very often tell us a lot even before we have understood the compound. i. The भूते कृदन्त functions most generally as an adjec

tive. Its placement in a HilH can be particularly helpful. a. If

F or other adjective occurs as the prior member of a समास, the समास is almost certain to be a $40K of the type discussed in 12.10.a.i. Examples: हतपुत्रः = हतः पुत्रः (m) slain son क्रुद्धब्राह्मणः = क्रुद्धो ब्राह्मणः (m) angry brāhman क्रुद्धबाह्मणो हतपुत्रं पश्यति ।

(The angry brāhman sees the slain son.)

b. If, on the other hand, the भूते कृदन्त of a सकर्मक root

occurs as the final member of a H1A, one is most likely dealing with a dy functioning as an ad jective. Moreover, since suchaभूते कृदन्तisa कर्मणि form, the समास is most likely to be तृतीया तत्पुरुष.

216

Examples: रामहत (adj) = रामेण हत slain by Rama शिष्यपठितानि (पुस्तकानि) = शिष्यैः पठितानि (पुस्तकानि) (books) read by students

ii. Since there is no limit to the number of members in a

H418 nor any restriction as to the types of compound functions possible within any one H4RH, there is no rea son why a 449 adjective so formed cannot then precede another noun and make a new compound and so on. Example: नृपहतपुत्रं पश्यति क्रुद्धबाह्मणः । (The angry brāhman sees the son slain by the king.)

शिष्यपठितपुस्तकानि न कदापि पठ्यन्ते ऽन्यैः जनैः ।

(Other people never read the books read by students.)

iii. A समास in which an adjective other than a भूते कृदन्त of

a सकर्मक root occurs as final member following a noun is very likely to be a HR4 adjective comparing some thing to the prior member in regard to the quality expressed by the final member. The word 59 (like) frequently appears in the fore of such compounds.

Examples: वृक्षतुङ्ग

वृक्ष इव तुङ्ग tall as a tree काककृष्ण काक इव कृष्ण black as a crow

12.14 Remember that the fate of compounds of whatever length is

carried out from right to left, one juncture at a time. Examples: (क = कर्मधारय; त = तत्पुरुष; तृ= तृतीया; ष= षष्ठी) समास

विग्रह नृप – हत – पुत्र → नृपेण हतः पुत्रः

क

तृत° (a son killed by a king)

217

जनक तनया स्नान—पुण्योदकम्

.

तु त

•

षत

षत

(Water sanctified by the bath of the daughter of Janaka.)

12.15 One may refer to a compound as a whole by the term describ

ing its final juncture. 12.16 Certain words have reduced or altered forms when they occur

in समास-s. Following areafew important examples.

a. Stems in -अन्and-इन् lose their final -when they are prior

members of समास-s and appear as -अ or -इ stems respec tively. Examples: समास विग्रह राजपुरुषः राज्ञः पुरुषः (king's man)

आत्महत्या आत्मनो हत्या (suicide) हस्तिनासा हस्तिनो नासा (elephant's trunk) राजर्षिः राजा ऋषिः (king-sage) The word T5F (m) (king) loses its final when it is at the end of most कर्मधारय and तत्पुरुष समास-s, thereby falling into the -31 declension. Examples: दशरथराजः दशरथो राजा

(King Dasaratha) राजराजः राज्ञां राजा

(king of kings) राजराजस्य (servant of the king of kings [Kubera]) Stems in -अन्त् take their weak form (-अत्) when they are prior members of समास-s.

b.

218

Examples: भगवद्गीता भगवतो गीता (the song of the Lord) हनूमत्सन्देशः हनूमतः सन्देशः (Hanuman's message)

When the very important adjective महन्त् (see 11.2.a) is the prior member of a कर्मधारय, it always takes the irregular form महा. समास

विग्रह

Meaning महाराजः (m) महानाजा (great king) महामुनयः (m) महान्तो मुनयः (great sages) महादेवी (1) महती देवी (great goddess) महामिथुनम् (n) महन्मिथुनम् । (great sexual union

of Siva and Pārvati) महायानम् (n) महद्यानम् (great vehicle)

d. The pronouns have special forms when they occur as prior

members of तत्पुरुष समास-s (their only use in compounds). i. The उत्तम पुरुष and मध्यम पुरुष pronouns अहम् and त्वम्

are represented by their weit forms for the number intended, regardless of the case-relation intended. Examples: मन्मनः (मत्+ मनः) मम मनः (my mind) अस्मद्वियोगः अस्मद् वियोगः (separation from us) युष्मन्मित्रम् युष्माकं मित्रम् (your friend) त्वत्कृते तव कृते (for your sake) त्वत्स्नेहः त्वयि स्नेहः (love for you)

ii. The प्रथमा पुरुष demonstrative pronouns सः, तत्, and सा

always appear in the एक नपुंसकलिङ्ग, प्रथमा fom तत् re gardless of the number, case, or gender intended.

Examples: तत्पुरुषः तस्य पुरुषः (his man (servant)) तत्पतिः तस्याः पतिः (her husband) तद्रतः

तस्मिनतः (devoted to that)219

12.17

3446 4418 : “Reduced-word" Compounds Several facili dye-s end in reduced forms of bare verbal roots, which signify the agent of the action of the verbal root. The prior member is often the of this root. Since these final members are 3446-1, "reduced words," in that they have no forms independent of such compounds, the faut-s require the substitution of a finite verbal form for the last member. This form is usually the genry adhes in the number and voice required. Examples: Root

समास

विग्रह

Meaning Viac (2P) Safaq* (m) agafar I (knower of

the Vedas) शास्त्राणि जानाति । (knower of

the śāstras) (2P) F67 (m) Pati (slayer of

Vợtra) 191 (1P) 144 (m) te fuafi (drinker of

· soma) As the above examples show, the long vowels of roots are short ened to make the stem forms. Roots ending in short vowels have a final added in generating these forms. Examples: VFS (1P) $resista* (m) si salati (conqueror

of Indra) कृ (8P) लोकक्षयकृत्* (m) लोकानां क्षयं करोति । (destroyer

of the worlds) *(for declensions see 21.1.b., c.) This formation occurs with case relations other than Grital, no tably with the roots V=14, VFN and V54. V=T4 is reduced to T. Examples:

ut:

खे गच्छति (sky-goer (bird)) गृहस्थः

गृहे तिष्ठति (householder) पादपः

पादेन पिबति (foot-drinker (tree)) GES:

ब्रह्मणो जायते (born from Brahman)

## 13 तुमनन्त (The Infinitive); समास Continued; बहुव्रीहि Application of कर्मधारय and तत्पुरुष समास-s, The द्विगु समास

गन्तुम्

से

An extremely useful and simple indeclinable of an "infinitive" or dative "infinitive" value may be formed freely from virtu ally all roots in the language. a. Formation of the Infinitive

The characteristic and invariable marker of this formation is the suffix -94. Before this suffix, the root vowel is sub ject to JM. Between the root and the suffix the vowel 5 is inserted in some cases. The pattern for the occurrence of this 3 and the stem itself is the same in each case as with the agentive suffix तु (10.0.ii; see too, 16.1). Examples:

कर्तुम्

(todo) गम्

(to go) श्रोतुम् (to hear) एतुम्

(to go) पठितुम् (to read) पतितुम् (to fall)

(to be) Vवच् वक्तुम्

(to say) Vग्रह ग्रहीतुम् (to take) b. The common root Vदृश् (to see) irregularly forms द्रष्टुम् (to

see) (instead of the expected गुण form). Vसृज् (1P) (create)

forms स्रष्टुम्. (See 16.5.b.i.) c. The suffix -तुम् preceded by the vowel इ replaces, as in the

formation of the gerund (11.7.a.iii), the final 37 of the present stem of roots of the tenth गण. Example:

चिन्त् चिन्तयितुम् (to think)

में में

भवितुम्

226

13.2

As in English, the infinitive may be used with an auxiliary verbal or nominal-verbal form. It serves as an infinitive in the sense of “to + verb." It frequently occurs with auxiliary verbs indicating desire, will, intent, capability, undertaking, etc. V Jelg14 Conf I want to hear that. VITA ET TORI. They don't want to go there. सहन् रावणं हन्तुं व्यवसायं करोति |He resolves to kill Ravana. 1745 174734RI He starts to leave her. Note that this 31022446 can take a 24. like a finite verb or verbal adjective. a. An extremely common occurrence of this usage is with

the fifth or Vē u root 27 (5P) (be able). This root rarely occurs except as an auxiliary to an infinitive. It should be memorized at once. Examples:

अव + गम् तत्पुस्तकमवगन्तुं न शक्नोति । (He is not able to understand that book.)

गम् स्वर्गं गन्तुं कथं शक्नुमः । (How are we able to go to heaven?)

जीव् रामेण विना न जीवितुं शक्नुवन्त्ययोध्यावासिनः । (The inhabitants of Ayodhyā are not able to live without Rāma.)

b. The form also occurs freely with verbs of motion in a "da

tive-infinitive" sense of "in order to," "for the purpose of," etc. Examples: Vदृश् अपि मां द्रष्टुं भवानागतवान् । (Did you come to see me?)

vos निशाचराणां विनाशनं कर्तुं वनं गतो लक्ष्मणपूर्वजः । (Lakşmaņa's elder brother (Rāma) went to the forest to bring about the destruction of the niśācara-s.)

227

c.

The infinitive occurs frequently with the auxiliary verb V3TE (1P) "to be worthy or capable.” The phrase (infinitive + finite form of 376) generally serves as a polite impera tive. Examples: 311 +V074 HARMaghelai (You ought to come = Please come.) Vश्रु मद्वचनं श्रीतुमर्हसि कैकेयि । (Kaikeyi, you ought to hear my words. = Please listen Kaikeyi.)

Vभू रामो राजा भवितुमर्हति । (Rāma should be king.)

13.3

The infinitive may be used "passively," with no change in form, if its auxiliary verb is in the cito at

Examples:

a asi 70- I can't say that.

Vवच

Vवच्

da agi 3742 (921) I That can't be said

(by me). 1 6 hi del medi Rāma goes to kill

Ei Application of HR and Ty

Anni

H4R-S is one of the most characteristically Sanskrit appli cations of nominal compounds. It is basically simple and even delightful in its conception, but often confuses students be cause they fail initially to grasp the idea. Before attacking these compounds it is necessary that a few points be under stood. Absolutely the most important thing to understand is that the alle is not a type of compound in the sense in which the कर्मधारय and तत्पुरुष समास-s are. To identify a compound as a बहुव्रीहि does not, as in the case of the कर्मधारय and तत्पुरुष, tell one

13.5

228

13.6

13.7

anything about the relationship between the members of the compound. Rather, the term acai indicates a secondary ap plication of a compound of the कर्मधारय or तत्पुरुष types. The term suggests the relationship of the whole compound (whose internal structure we must determine as discussed in Lesson 12) to some other word outside the compound. The usage of rail- is based on the fact that, in Sanskrit, any noun may function as an adjective with no special adjectival marker, when and only when it occurs as the last member of a कर्मधारय or तत्पुरुष समास. In other words, unless its last mem ber is already an adjective (see 12.13), any PTER or deyee compound can do double service both as a noun in its own right or, when used as a Caire, as an adjective. English has several examples that may illustrate this interest ing usage. a. When Paul Revere cried, "The redcoats are coming!", he

was not really referring to coats at all. What he really meant to say was that the men whose coats were red were on their way. The issue was of more than purely sartorial significance. In the same way, when we refer to someone as a loudmouth, bluestocking, blue-blood, yellow-belly, fathead, or redhead, we are not talking about mouths, stock ings, blood, etc. We mean people who possess the things mentioned. When we talk of paperbacks, redwings, large mouths, or sulphur-bottoms, we are speaking of books, birds, fish, and whales. In all of these cases, the com pounds (mostly कर्मधारय-s) serve as adjectives (विशेषण-s) modifying some other noun, which may be implied or ex pressed. In none of these cases would it be possible simply to use the uncompounded final noun as an adjective. We can call a man a redcoat or redcap, but not just coat or cap. The same situation prevails in Sanskrit. The only differ ence is that whereas in English this usage is restricted to a few compounds, most of which are internally of the HURA229

a

13.8

13.9

type, in Sanskrit the usage may be applied freely to almost any कर्मधारय or तत्पुरुष compound whose final member is a

noun. The structure of a dife-sis no different from that of the under lying compound in each case. It is only the fact that, in explaining both the underlying compound relation and the re lation of the whole compound to something outside it, differentiates the forms. The que must of course be supplied by us. aal H4TH-s can be easily identified by contextual criteria, and in many cases by formal criteria. a. The formal criteria are quite simple. Since the essence of

the al function is that certain nouns serve as adjec tives, then such nouns must behave as adjectives. They must take on the gender of the noun (outside the compound) that they modify. If, as is often, but (alas!) not always the case, the final member is of a different inherent gender than that of the noun being modified, then it must lose its inherent gender and be treated as an adjective of its own stem final. Thus, we may take the कर्मधारय समास “पीताम्बरम' (विग्रह-पीतमम्बरम्) ("yellow clothing"), which is नपुंसकलिङ्ग (neuter), and make it serve as an adjective modifying a go (masculine) noun (e.g., :) in the sense of the man whose clothes are yellow, the man with the yellow clothes. But in order to do this, the neuter 31024 must be brought into agreement with 954. This is done by treat ing it as an adjective in -34 (its proper stem final). Thus, while fraisley means, "yellow clothes, " HakkaR: can only mean, "the man or god with yellow clothes." By the same token, tahat can only mean "the woman with yellow clothes." In the same way, the षष्ठी तत्पुरुष—गजाननम् (विग्रह

R147,"the face of an elephant") must, if it appears as 151677:, mean "the man or god who has the face of an el

230

ephant." The adjectival treatment

inal nouns is occasionally confusing since nouns may take forms that they never have in their regular paradigms. Examples:

TH HEIG STT: (brilliant Rāma)

6946 Praha (Hanumān having accomplished his duty)

Here the nato nouns ts: and at must be declined as पुंलिङ्ग nouns to agree with रामः and हनुमान्. Thus तेजः is treated like the stems ending in 31: (e.g., 31157: [9.1.b]), while कर्मन् is declined like the पुंलिङ्ग stems ending in -अन् (e.g., 31164(8.5.a.i]). Thus, when a final noun of a compound appears with a gender other than its inherent gender, you

can be virtually certain that the compound is a बहुव्रीहि. b. If the inherent gender of the compound-final member is

the same as that of the noun being modified, we are still able to identify the site by the context, just as we know that in the sentence, “His father was a black-shirt," we do not intend to propagate a theory of spontaneous genera tion from filthy laundry. Take as an example the site compound "EGIE:" ("man with a lot of rice"). This is a Gaile application of the CHER HAKI"called" (m) (faut

), “much rice." Now if the compound is to serve as an adjective modifying, or referring to, a man, there will be no formal distinction between the two usages, since alle: is les to begin with. Even so, in the sentence 376415 H बहुव्रीहिर्वसति भार्यया सह । (“In our village a bahuvrihi lives with his wife"), it is clear that a person, not rice, is being referred to. However, since only rice appears to be men tioned as the subject of the sentence, there can be no doubt that the compound is used in a fait application. By the same token, in the sentence सा बहुव्रीहिं पचतीति श्रुत्वा बहुब्राह्मणास्तं allagane I (Having heard, “She is cooking bahuvrihi,”

231

many brahmans come to eat it.), it is clear that the simple

कर्मधारय is meant. 13.10 fue of a 4-

a. The analysis of a faire application of a Hurd must provide

two levels of information: i. It must serve as a focus of the underlying form (or forms)

i.e., Chura or dyan. It must clarify the relation of the H4n as a whole to whatever it modifies and, at the same time, indicate

clearly that the compound is a बहुव्रीहि. b. This information is provided by a conventionalized proce

dure for विग्रह of बहुव्रीहि-s. The steps of this procedure are as follows: i. Give the face of the underlying compound in the same

order in which the members appear in the compound. This is to establish, as in Lesson 12, whether the un derlying compound form is a कर्मधारय or तत्पुरुष. It is very important to note here that this step is done with out reference to the daile, or adjectival application of the compound. Therefore, the final member and any preceding adjective are given in their proper inherent

gender. ii. Immediately after this faus appears a form of the rela

tive pronoun—:, 46, or I. This is the unmistakable

marker of the बहुव्रीहि's विग्रह. The number and gender of this form are determined by the number and gender of the noun that the file 418 modifies. The case of the form is determined by the relationship of the un derlying members of the compound to the noun modified. This relative form, then, specifies the way in which the acil is to be understood. As in the case of the विग्रह forms of prior members of तत्पुरुष समास-s, this relative form may be in any case but the gen.

232

Again, however, as with dyear, the poot and diren

H -s, in that order, are most common, with the 46741 running a poor third, and the rest occurring less fre

quently. iii. After this relative form, its correlative appears either

in the case in which it actually occurs in the sentence in question, or in the 941 followed by this case. Of ten the 9441 is replaced or supplemented by a repetition of the whole (now completely analyzed) CEGIR HHH

in the प्रथमा. iv. So in the example R: ("he whose clothes are yel

low," epithet of Vişnu), the fou would proceed as follows: 443R 9 A: (

UR:) (yellow) (clothing) (of whom) (he) (is pītāmbarah) This is, "whose clothing is yellow is pitämbaraḥ." Here, the first stage is the four of the simple underly ing कर्मधारय, with the adjective पीत modifying and agreeing with the neuter 37-6R4. Since the noun which the compound modifies (Vişnu) is gt- and since the relation of this noun to the final member (315kh is possessive, the relative is in the षष्ठी एक°, पुंलिङ्ग. If the same form occurred in another case, we could, to be meticulously correct, add the appropriate case form of the correlative as the final step, but we could omit the qe form. Example: 11 HalRRI 74: 1 (Homage to Vişnu!) A typical face would be: Haytar ... If the phrase were: Halha : (a devotee of Visnu) The विग्रह could read: पीतमम्बरं यस्य तस्य..., but it would have to be clearly understood that the तस्य and the यस्य

233

13.11 a.

are neither in apposition nor agreement. The 24 refers to the relationship between अम्बरम् and विष्णुः and defines the file relation. The all, on the other hand, is simply a reference to the quite accidental fact that the compound happens to be in the 40t in this sentence. An appositional -4414 would be analyzed as follows: सागरमेखला (having the ocean for a girdle) = प्रथिवी (1) (the earth). विग्रह—सागरो (m). मेखला (1), यस्याः सा

(सागरमेखला) (she whose girdle is the ocean). As noted above (12.13.a.i), it is very common for कर्मधारय समास-s to have भूते कृदन्त-s of सकर्मक roots as prior mem bers. When such compounds are applied as बहुव्रीहि-s, it is usual for therelative pronoun of the विग्रह (13.10.b.ii) to be in the gate and to construe with the prior member. Examples: folding 4: (one who has conquered the senses) (conquered) (sense) विग्रहः जितानीन्द्रियाणि येन सः (जितेन्द्रियः) (he by whom the senses are conquered)

कृतकर्मा (one who has performed an action) (performed) (action) विग्रहः

कृतं कर्म येन सः (कुतकर्मा) (he by whom the action is performed)

पीतोदकी

(one [f] who has drunk water, (drunk) (water) or whose water is drunk) विग्रहः पीतमुदकं यया सा (पीतोदकी) (she by whom the water is drunk)

or

पीतमुदकं यस्याः साः (पीतोदका) (she whose water is drunk)

234

बहुव्रीहि समास-s of this type may be used like the भूते कृदन्त itself to denote a perfective or completed action (10.6.a). Example: हतमृगान् सिंहान्पश्यामि । (I see the lions who have killed the deer.) विग्रहः हता मृगा यैस्तान्

b. When the भूते कृदन्त is of an अकर्मक root or has no clear

04111 application, it is normally treated as any other adjec tive and the relative construes with the last member. Example: स्थितप्रज्ञस्य का भाषा ।

(What is the description of the man of established intellect?)

विग्रहः

स्थिता प्रज्ञा यस्य तस्य ।।

13.12

बहुव्रीहि application may also beeasily made of तत्पुरुष compounds. Example:

गजाननः (elephant-faced one = Ganesa) विग्रहः गजस्याननं यस्य सः ।

13.

e-s may be of any length and may occur, like any other adjective, as members of other compounds. Examples: बहुशोणितलिप्तशरीरः (whose body is covered with lots of blood) विग्रहः

बहुना शोणितेन लिप्तं शरीरं यस्य सः

हतपुत्रब्राह्मणः (brahman whose son has been killed or who has killed his son)

235

विग्रहः हतः पुत्रो यस्य/येन स ब्राह्मणः

13.14 As is clear from the विग्रह, a बहुवीहि समास may replace an entire

relative clause. Example:

शुद्धमना मे प्रियः । यस्य मनः शुद्धं स मे प्रियः ।

(The man of pure mind is dear to me.) 13.15 बहुव्रीहि-s are extremely common as names and epithets.

Examples: Name/Epithet

विग्रह बहदश्वः (having great horses) बहन्तो ऽश्वा यस्य सः नीलकण्ठः (having a blue throat = Śiva) नीलः कण्ठो यस्य सः हलायुधः (having a plowshare हलमायुधं यस्य सः

for a weapon = Balarāma) वीरसेनः

(having an army of heroes) वीराणां सेना यस्य सः मषिकवाहनः (having a rat

मूषिको वाहनं यस्य सः for a mount = Ganesa)

lunn

13.16 The द्विगु समास -

The ("two cow") समास is a kind of कर्मधारय of which the first member is a numeral. (For declension of numerals see 19.6.) This type of compounding is not normally used simply to enumerate things. Its major uses are: a. To denote aggregates or sets of things of which the num

ber is well known. The 2007 is always used regardless of the numeral involved. Examples: त्रिभुवनम्

(the three worlds) सप्तपदी

(the seven steps of a marriage ceremony)

(the three worlds) पञ्चरात्रम्

(the five nights of a certain rite)

(n)

त्रिलोकम्

236

b. As cai-s in the sense of names or epithets:

Name/Epithet

विग्रह दशरथः (having ten chariots) GEIT AT H: दशग्रीवः (having ten necks दश ग्रीवा यस्य सः

= Rāvana) त्रिलोचनः (having three eyes त्रीणि लोचनानि यस्य सः

= Siva) दशबलः

(having ten powers दश बलानि यस्य सः = Buddha)

## 14 समास Concluded; The द्वन्द्व and अव्ययीभाव समास-s; The विधि लिङ् (Optative)

14.0

14.1

There remain two basic types of compounds to be examined. These are rather different from the preceding two types and their all applications, but they are extremely simple and require only the briefest treatment. The 6-6 H4 The first of these is the && HATH, sometimes given the racy title of “copulative compound." This compound differs from the basic कर्मधारय and तत्पुरुष types in that it does not consist of sets of pairs but is simply a stringing together of any number of nouns, which in ordinary syntax would be connected by the conjunctive particle 7 or, in rare cases, the disjunctive particle al. Since the items are simply listed, there is no grammatical subordination of one member to another. Still, the formation of the && is the same as that of the others insofar as prior members lose their 94-s or case endings.

a. The gender of a && is the same as that of its final

member. Thus:

सीतारामौ = सीता च रामश्च (Sītā and Rāma)

14.2

सुतकन्ये = सुतश्च कन्या च (son and daughter)

b. Number is determined not by the number of members of

the compound but by the number of things represented by these members, thus cayet (the god and the man), but

4511: (gods and men). There is no limit to the number of members in a &-&, e.g., देवासुरगन्धर्वपिशाचराक्षसाः (The gods, asuras, gandharvas, piśācas, and rākşasas).

242

14.3

In some cases, especially when a pair (द्वन्द्व) of nouns is

closely associated, it may be represented by a && with the नपुंसकलिङ्ग एकवचन ending. Examples: सुखदुःखम् (pleasure and pain) This a common technique for linking pairs of opposites. श्रुताश्रुतम् (what is heard and what is not heard) कृताकृतम् (what is done and what is not done)

14.4

द्वन्द्व-s may be included in extended समास-s. In the विग्रह of such compounds, the & -s are left intact. Examples: a. वीर्यबुद्धिसंपन्न (endowed with valor and intelligence)

द्वन्द्व

तुत विग्रह = वीर्यबुद्धिभ्यां संपन्न

b. सुखदुःखद (causing pleasure and pain)

द्वित विग्रह = सुखदुःखे ददाति

c. रक्तलिप्तहस्तमुखः (having hands and face smeared with blood)

तृत

विग्रह = रक्तेन लिप्तानि हस्तमुखानि यस्य सः

14.5

The order of words in a द्वन्द्व is not, as in other types of समास,of any syntactic significance. There are, however, a number of

243

rules laid down by the grammarians that regulate word order. The two most important such rules, in order of precedence are: a. A word signifying a person or thing of greater importance

or entitled to greater honor or precedence precedes one signifying someone or something less worthy. Example: ब्राह्मणक्षत्रियवैश्यशूद्राः (brāhmans, ksatriyas, vaiśyas, and sudras) (the four classes of Indian society in descending order)

b. If rule 'a' does not apply, a word with fewer syllables pre

cedes one with more. Example: 31fetgach (14.3) (snake and mongoose)

14.6

When a kinship term ending in - - (10.0.i) precedes another such term or the word F: in a &&, its stem vowel is changes to आ. Example: H + P Mail art (mother and father)

14.7

te G : Elliptical Dual In a few cases, when two nouns, especially kinship terms, are extremely closely associated as a natural pair, the face of one of them may be used to express the & S. Example: Pri (=htalart) (mother and father)

14.8

The &-&, then, is perhaps the most rudimentary form of nomi nal compound. There is only one point worth stressing: despite the fact that when a && is subjected to love, all the members are in the same case, this type of H41 should clearly be distin guished from a URT HRH, for which this is also the case due to H46M .

244

14.9

14.10

FORINTH418 : Indeclinable Compound Another relatively common typeof समास is called अव्ययीभावसपास, or indeclinable (304) nominal compound. As the name im plies, these compounds function as adverbs. They are formed by the junction of an 3702146 (as prior member) and a nominal stem (as final member). The endings of the final members of these compounds are usu ally changed so as to conform to the 944-faciat 500 797.815 endings of nouns of the various stem finals. Some stem finals are, however, reduced. a. Final members ending in -37 take the ending -374 though

नपुसक nouns may take -अ. Final long vowels are shortened. Examples: 78 + 2014: → 7199744 (according to desire) ufa + 3174: → प्रत्यग्नि (facing the fire)

31f87154 (upon the king)

14.11 The prior member, or 3104146, most often belongs to one of

three categories: a. 3471

Examples: ufa + fart: (m) (day) faiga (every day)

14.12 विधि लिङ् : The Optative Mode

The fare 5 is the last important conjugation to be based on the U-s of the present system. It is a mode of the present system, just as the cate, or imperative, is a mode, and it had two

major uses. 1. Prescription. In this usage, the लिङ् indicates that the

subject should, ought, must generally, or had better, per

246

LO1

er

form the action or undergo the state expressed by the ver bal root. As such, it serves a similar (injunctive) function as that of the St. The difference is that here the "com mand" is usually of a general sort.

Examples:

अपण्डितः पण्डितसभायां मौनं समाश्रयेत् । (In an assembly of the wise, a fool should resort to silence.)

VTT)

यो मोक्षमिच्छति स वनं गच्छेत् । (He who wishes liberation should go to the forest.)

स्थितधीः* किं प्रभाषेत किमासीत व्रजेत किम् ।

(How would a man of firm intelligence speak, how sit, and how move about?)

न वदेद्यावनी भाषां प्राणैः कण्ठगतैरपि । (One should not speak a Western language even to save one's life.) *See 21.3.h

2. Hypothesis. In this usage, the fs is used conditionally

to indicate either a state contrary to fact, or one which is probable but not certain. The first of these usages is most common in relative clauses, while the second is common in the sense of "might," "may," or "would." Examples: रामो यदि वनाज्झटिति नागच्छेत्तर्यहं यमलोकं गच्छेयम् । (If Rāma should not return at once from the forest, then I would die.) (Literally, “would go to Yama's realm.")

रामो वीरो न स्यात्कथं जीवेयुः पुरुषाः । (If Rāma were not a hero, how would men live?)

247

यः को ऽपीदं पुस्तकं पठेत्स शतयज्ञफलं प्राप्नुयात् । (Whoever should read this book, he would attain the fruit of a hundred sacrifices.)

यथा काष्ठं च काष्ठं च समेयातां महोदधौ । समेत्य च व्यपेयातां तद्वद्भूतसमागमः ।। (Just as two bits of driftwood might come together in the ocean, and, having met, might go their separate ways, just so is the coming together of living beings.)

यदहरेव विरजेत्तदहरेव प्रव्रजेत् । (On the very day that one turns away from the things of this world, one should wander forth [as an ascetic]).

14.13 The विधि लिङ् is unlike the other modes of the present system

(लट्, लङ्, लोट्) in that it is distinguished not by particular per sonal endings but by a special mode-sign that is inserted between the present stem (7.5) and, for the most part, the sec

ondary endings (8.9). 14.14 Mode Sign of the विधि लिङ्

The optative mode-sign is basically & for all forms except the परस्मैपद forms of roots belonging to the non-अ गण-s (2, 3, 5, 7, 8,9). For these roots, the mode-sign is 91. In the case of the 37 गण-s (1, 4, 6, 10), the mode-sign ई coalesces with the preced

ing अ of the गण-sign to form ए. 14.15 The various cases are best considered individually by voice

and by type of गण. a. परस्मैपद

i. अ गण-s

a. The mode-sign ई plus the अ of the गण-sign yield

ए, which is then the characteristic sign of the विधि लिङ् of the roots of these गण-s. The endings are the normal secondaryendings, but the प्रथम बहुवचन

248

ending is always -3: and never -377. b. The ए (गण-sign + mode-sign) is never allowed to

come into contact with an initial vowel of a per sonal ending (e.g., -अम्, -3:). Such contact is avoided by the insertion of between them. Examples: गच्छ + ई + अम् → गच्छेयम् (I would, should, might go.)

वद + ई + 3: → वदेयुः

(They would, should, might say.) c. Thus, the conjugation of VH (1P) in the fara fesse

would be:

एक

बहु प्र° भवेत्

भवेयुः म° भवेः भवेतम् भवेत उ० भवेयम् भवेव भवेम

भवेताम्

ii. non-अ गण-s

The mode-sign 9 is added to the weak form of the stem regardless of the usual strong-weak distinction of present stems. The endings are the same as for the अ गण-s, but the mode-sign loses its आ before theend ing 3:

Example: प्र + Vआप (5P) (attain)

एक द्वि

बहु प्र प्राप्नुयात् प्राप्नुयाताम् प्राप्नुयुः म प्राप्नुयाः प्राप्नुयातम् प्राप्नुयात

प्राप्नुयाम् प्राप्नुयाव प्राप्नुयाम

성평

ii. You should learn the paradigms of the two important ___ roots /अस् (2P) and Vकृ (8P). In accordance with (ii)

above, the foot of 374 is based on the weak stem,249

b.

which is . Thus, the paradigm is: go RICE FIGUR FY: etc. These forms are useful. FiEL means "maybe," "per haps," etc. V is, as always, irregular. Here it loses its final stem vowel 3 before the mode-sign.

Para Petary ory: etc. Fill out and memorize both paradigms. 31TH YG i. 37 Tu-s

The mode-sign is as at 14.15.a.i.a above. The endings are the regular 311646146 secondary endings, except that the उत्तम एक° has अ. and the प्रथम बहु° has -रन्, instead of and -37R, respectively. The 10-sign plus mode sign (=) is, as in 14.15.a.i.b., not permitted to come into contact with an initial vowel of an ending. Examples:

4 + $ +31 → (I should, would, might get.)

भाष् + ई आताम् → भाषेयाताम् (They (two) might speak.)

ii. non-31 1-5

The mode-sign is always added to the weak stem. Since most 311 CHRYG forms are weak anyway, this is not as surprising as it is in the RAYE forms. As in i. above, the mode-sign is set off from a following vowel by य. Example: 405 + $ + 34 → positi (I would, should, etc., eat.)

14.16

The 3rait fast, or the Benedictive Grouped by the grammarians with the fato fois, but not formed from the present stem, is a somewhat rare conjugational mode

250

known as the 3172fir fois, or optative of blessing. It is used as the name implies mainly for uttering blessings or prayers. Its detailed formation is complicated and need not concern the beginning student. However, its 5145 ° forms may be encountered occasionally. Examples: भूयात्

भूयास्ताम्

भूयासुः May it be! May those two be! May they be!

EXERCISES

Translate the reading into English. List and identify all fos (optative) forms and substitute for them the corresponding te (imperative) forms. Translate the following into Sanskrit (See English-Sanskrit Glossary at end of lesson):

1. If a man would experience bliss, let him go to the forest

and there sit long in meditation. 2. Having left the city and become a muni, how then should

I speak to you, friend. 3. Are all brāhmans men of stabilized mind? How should

I know? It is not known to me whether they are all sages

or not (use यत् and न वा and इति). 4. Having done what, might men attain liberation? A man

should do what is written in the śāstras. Thereby he may

become liberated. 5. If I should not see the faces of Rāma and Lakşmaņa (use

&-&) again, I should surely be afflicted by great sorrow. 6. Let Lakşmaņa go with Sītā and Rāma (use ) if he wishes

to fulfill (use V) truth and duty (UH, use 56). 7. If they were not afflicted by birth, old age, and fear of

death (use &6), men might be happy. Moreover, (3119 a) having experienced disease, poverty, sorrow, and disas ters (use &-&), they would be of agitated minds.

## 15 वर्तमाने कृदन्तः (The Present Participle)

15.0

With the fara fess (optative) we learned the last verbal conju gation of the present system. However, there is still one participial (i.e., nominal) form based on the present stem. This form, the present participle, is of very common occurrence and great usefulness. It is, like the art and other non-conju gational verbal forms, an excellent example of classical Sanskrit's tendency to depart from the false forms. It func tions like

in that it, too, is both adjectival (in that it must agree in case, number, and gender with the noun to which it refers) and verbal (in that it must have a da (gram matical subject]) and may, if formed from a H is root, have a कर्मन् (direct object). Its relation to the भूते कृदन्त is very

much like that of the कर्तरि to the कर्मणि प्रयोग. That is, it is subject-referent, i.e., is in grammatical agreement with its te while the Ta Gat (of a H+24root) is object-referent, i.e., in agreement with its 04. Its use, however, is rather different. The use of the art PGRI. The a rt any is basically a simple formation. Neverthe less, the use of this form, like that of bail AARA-s, and the

for seitl, is sometimes confusing to the beginner. There fore, it requires some explanation. There are basically two reasons for confusion regarding this participle, one conceptual and significant, the other mechani cal and trivial. a. The latter, trivial reason is nothing more than the fact that

certain common forms of the participle are identical with some common finite verbal forms. This, however, is rarely the cause of real ambiguity. This minor issue will be dis cussed below (15.13).

15.1

15.2

256

b. The major reason for misunderstanding the function of the

ad PGR is a failure to understand that the participle is limited, unlike the a rt, to a status in a sentence sub ordinate to another finite verb or its equivalent. The present participle can never substitute for the principal verb of a sentence or an independent clause. In this it is rather like the gerund (see 11.5). Thus, although Ta a: (or Tesla, 3MTOT, 1919, TEOg etc.) is a complete sentence, the phrases i. 74 R eall air) ii. 11 1989 ( GRI) require an independent verbal phrase just as clearly as do their English equivalents: i. Rāma, having gone to the forest, ... and ii. Rāma, going to the forest, ... The "resolution" of these sentence fragments must be a finite verb or some nominal equivalent. For example, the phrases i. and ii.could be resolved by the clause 44444. The sentences would now read: . i. 274Ral 4442401 ii. 7 a TE-A443401 which would mean: i. Having gone to the forest, Rāma saw a sage. ii. (While) going to the forest, Rāma saw a sage. [or]

Rāma, (who was going to the forest, saw a sage. As the above sentences show, the major difference with regard to usage, between Sale and the adHA EGR, is that the action expressed by the former is more or less perfective while the action expressed by the latter is more or less imperfective. The call is used to indicate an action that is completed by the time of the action expressed by the finite verb of the comple mentary independent clause. The adH GRI, on the other hand, generally expresses an action that is in process at the

15.3

257

15.4

time of the action of the independent verb so the two actions (or states) are more or less simultaneous. Thus in sentence (i) above we would understand that Rāma had already completed his journey to the forest before he saw the sage. In (ii) he sees the sage while he is still on his way. a. This expression of simultaneous actions maybe otherwise

accomplished by the compound sentences of the type UGL... GI etc., (6.5 ff.) that have been introduced earlier. Examples: i. यदा रामो वनमगच्छत्तदा स मुनिमपश्यत्

(When Rāma went to the forest, he saw a sage.)

ii. यः पुरुषः कृष्णं भजति स मोक्षं लभते ।

(The man who worships Kļşņa, [he] attains liberation.)

1

An important function of the Gal is to serve as a substitute for such relative clauses. The above examples might be paraphrased as follows: i. A TERH YA443401

ii. qui 45-46) hei au b. If you always remember first to translate a ada cima

regardless of its case, as a subordinate or relative clause, you will have no difficulty with the form. Afterwards, if you feel the result is not always the best English, you may change the English wording; but you will have understood the sentence. It is impossible to stress this point too strongly because the वर्तमाने कृदन्त, like the भूते कृदन्त, is a verbal adjective and must, therefore, agree in case, number, and gender with the noun it modifies. If, however, you try to express the case of this adjective separately, you will not

understand the sentence. a. Consider the following sentence:

वनं गच्छता रामेण मुनिर्दृश्यते । (Rāma, going to the forest, sees the sage.)

15.5

258

Here we see the वर्तमाने कृदन्त of the root /गम् in its तृतीया, 20, form. Now the structure of the finite phrase of the sentence is clear: रामेण मुनिर्दृश्यते । (The sage is seen by Rāma.)

b. The remainder of the sentence, C Codl, requires some

explanation. i. Two specific questions arise:

a. Why is गच्छता in the तृतीया?

b. What is the syntactical role of a 14 in the sentence? ii. The answers to these questions are:

a. Egil is in the air because, being an adjective,

it must agree in case, number, and gender with the noun it modifies. Since 7441 is , 24, gtos and Tradi modifies 744, it must be the same. This does not mean that the action of "going" is to be understood or translated as being agentive

or instrumental! b. 024 is facili, h, ja and is the locus of mo

tion of the action of the root V14 as expressed in

the form गच्छता (see 4.38). iii. In these two questions (and answers) lies the whole

explanation of the function of the वर्तमाने कृदन्त. It is nominal in that it is an adjective and it is verbal in that it can (if formed from a H4 root) have a direct object. As such, it can serve as a transition between two separate clauses by serving as an adjective in one

and as a verb in the other. iv. Thus, in our example the words 9-14 and 144 each

relate in a different way to the key word for the first as locus of motion of a verb and the second as the governing noun of an adjective. It is as though 144 were the subject of two different clauses, of which the verbs were derived from V-14 and Ved respectively.259

v. Because of this dual nature of the present participle,

we should translate it as a verb of a subordinate or

relative clause. vi. We should then translate

वनं गच्छता र (The sage is seen by Rāma, who is going to the for est.) (or) (Rāma, while going to the forest, sees a sage.) a. Remember that the TFGR is a verbal adjec

tive and not a verbal noun. Therefore it is no more proper to attempt to give its own case relation than it is with an ordinary (nonverbal) adjective. Thus if (as many beginning Sanskritists do) one were to translate the phrase: 144 Tegll as "by Rāma's going ...," it would be as great an error as to trans

late <TH PIHA as “by the dark of Rāma..." b. There are indeed many true nouns derived from the

verbal roots (Lesson 20). The Art PGRI, how ever, may be easily distinguished from these (and all other verbal adjectives) by the fact that it is formed from the present stems of the various roots,

rather than from the roots themselves. Formation of the वर्तमाने कृदन्त The H G has one feature more characteristic of verbal than of nominal forms. Unlike the other participial formations learned thus far (the EGR (Lesson 10) and HAR(11.4) constructions), it distinguishes voice. Like finite verbs it has different endings according to whether its verbal root is conju gated in the 31164246 or 74. a. The E46 participle may be formed quite mechanically.

The stem form is discovered in each case by dropping the final इof the प्रथम, बहु, परस्मैपद form of वर्तमाने लट् (present

indicative). i. Thus, the "active" participle of the following roots may

be generated as follows:

15.6

260

सन्ति

सन्त्

root

प्रथम बहु लट् participle stem गम् (1) गच्छन्ति गच्छन्त् Vश्रु (5) शृण्वन्ति शृण्वन्त Vकु (8) कुर्वन्ति कुर्वन्त् Vभी (3) बिभ्यति बिभ्यत्

अस् (2)

छिद् (7) छिन्दन्ति छिन्दन्त ii. The forms thus generated are ones with a strong/weak

alternation of -अन्त्/-अत्. The only exception to this is that roots of the third (which have no 7 in their प्रथम बहु परस्मैपद लट् forms [see 7.25]), therefore havea participial stem form in-37d, which then has no strong/

weak alternation. All its forms are in this sense "weak." iii. The paradigm is thus the same as that given at 11.1,

with the single important exception that the पुंलिङ्ग, एक, प्रथमा is always formed without length of the final अ. Examples:

पश् (4) सीतां पश्यनामो मुदितो ऽभवत् । (Seeing Sītā, Rāma became happy.)

श्रु (5) मधुराञ्छब्दाञ्छृण्वन्सुखितो ऽपि पर्युत्सुको भवेत् । (Even a happy man, when he hears sweet sounds, might be stricken by longing.)

भी (3) राक्षसेभ्यो बिभ्यदृषिधैरवनमत्यजत् । (Fearing the raksasa-s, the rsi left the terrible forest.)

आ + गम् (1) भवन्तमागच्छन्तं दृष्ट्वा सर्व उत्तिष्ठन्तु । (Seeing you coming, let everyone rise.) Vवस् (1), सम् + Vवद् (1) वने वसद्धिर्मुनिभिः सह संवदतो जनान् रामलक्ष्मणौ सस्नेहं पश्यतः । (Rāma and Lakşmaņa view with affection the people, who are conversing with the sages dwelling in the for est.)

261

iv. The Fall forms of the participle are formed by the

suffixation of $ to either the strong or weak stem (de pending on the ) and are declined regularly according to7.1. The ई is added: a. to the strong stem in गण-s 1,4 and 10.

Examples: root

m. stem f. stem Vवद् (1) वदन्त्

वदन्ती

b. to the strong or weak stem for 14 6 and for roots

of the 2nd Mending in 311, although the strong stem is perhaps more common. Examples: root m. stem f.stem Vतुद् (6) तुदन्त् तुदन्ती/तुदती Vया (2) यान्त

यान्ती/याती

c. to the weak stem for all others.

Examples: root m. stem f.stem

कृ (8) कुर्वन्त् कुर्वती छिद् (7) छिन्दन्त छिन्दती

v. The नपुंसकलिङ्ग is formed in general from the weak stem

-अत् and its declension is the same as that of neuter stems in-वन्त् or-मन्त् (11.1.b)except in the प्रथमा, द्वितीया and संबोधन द्विवचन forms where stem-strength occurs in accordance with the pattern of the feminine. For example:

गम् एक द्वि बहु°

प्र० गच्छत् गच्छन्ती गच्छन्ति द्वि० गच्छत् । गच्छन्ती गच्छन्ति

सम् गच्छत् गच्छन्ती गच्छन्ति

262

15.7

The आत्मनेपद stem form of the वर्तमाने कृदन्त, which, as with the finite verbs, has no semantic value to distinguish it from the RE4G, is generated simply by: a. adding -414 to present stems of roots of the 34 70-s (1,4,6,

and 10). Examples: root stem form Vभाष (1A) भाषमाण (See 3.59 for सन्धि.)

147 (4A) PRIR b. adding -376 to the weak present stems of the non-37 10-S

(2,3,5,7,8,9). Examples: root stem form Viac (2) farmy (See 3.59 for H .) vą (8) gaator VE (3) 9811 Since the 31164614G forms are all -37 stems, their declension is of no difficulty. The h os endings are:

teş: . -37:

नपुंसकलिङ्गः -अम् and स्त्रीलिङ्गः -आ d. The use of the आत्मनेपद is just like that of the परस्मैपद.

Example: अहं कामान कदापि त्यजेयमिति मन्यमानेषु पुरुषेषु वैराग्यं कथमुद्भवेत् । . (How could vairāgya arise among men who think, “I would never abandon sensual pleasures?")

c.

15.8

A कर्मणि (or भावे) equivalent of the वर्तमाने कृदन्त may be formed from the 1 stem of any verbal root. As in the case of finite verbs, this participle is formed with the 31164-146 ending, which, for this form, is invariably -HF. As with any

c r it form, this participle agrees with the 24 or object of the action expressed by its verbal root, if the root is Hap , or transitive.

15.9

263

Examples: रामेण हन्यमाना राक्षसा दूरं गच्छन्ति यथा वायुना नुद्यमानानि पर्णानि । (The rākşasa-s, being slain by Rāma, go far away, like leaves driven by the wind.)

मया दृश्यमानासु कन्यासु सीतोत्तमेति मन्ये ऽहम् । (I think that among the girls I see (lit., being seen by me), Sītā is the best.)

15.10

There are a number of special or idiomatic applications of the AR GR which, if studied carefully, greatly increase one's ability to understand and generate sophisticated Sanskrit sentences: a. The वर्तमाने कृदन्त of the root /अस् (सन्त सत् सती), "being," is

quite useful. One of its regular idiomatic applications is with the F141a (particle) 3714 to indicate a situation contrary to normal expectation. Examples: ब्राह्मणः सन्नपि स न वेदज्ञः । (Even though he is a brāhman, he is not a knower of the Vedas.)

सुन्दरी सत्यपि दुर्गा न विवाहिता । (Even though she is beautiful, Durgā is not married.)

i. This sense of “even though” may be conveyed by 319

and the GR of any other root as well. Example: पुस्तकं पठनप्यर्थं नावगच्छामि । (Even though I read the book, I don't understand the meaning.)

b. The वर्तमाने कृदन्त of the आत्मनेपद roots Vवृत् (1A) and V विद्

(4Ā), "to be, exist," (adh and fagyra) in the sense of “existing," "going on," "present," have several common uses.

264

i. The participle he can be used as an adjective mean

ing present" or even as the noun the present." It is from this form that we have the grammatical term 47

MC, or the VC (indicative) used in the present. ii. The negative of the participle of viac, 31 ehf is used

in order toprovide the विग्रह of a particularkindof बुहव्रीहि समास. In this kind of समास, the prior member is the negative particle 31, which here serves as a sort of ad jective meaning not-existing. When such a compound is subjected to foue, however, a real word is required. The word is usually supplied by the participle अविद्यमान. Example: समास

विग्रह

meaning 3142544 (7544) 31EMAT: G61 a (realm) having

HTCL no men

c. Another common use of this participle is as a true continu

ative or "imperfective." This is done by making use of the simultaneity of the participial action with a finite form of a verb of motion or of standing still. Examples:

(1P) (sing) गायन्नागच्छति ।

(He comes singing.)


(speak)

तया सह संभाषमाण आस्ते । (He is speaking with her (lit., He sits speaking with her.])

Van

(1P)

(laugh)

हसंस्तिष्ठति । (He goes on laughing (lit., He stands laugh ing.)

265

15.11

सति सप्तमी and सतः षष्ठी : Absolute Constructions Two of the most common and characteristic idiomatic uses of the participles, especially the present participles, are the Ha सप्तमी and सतः षष्ठी or locative and genitive absolute construc tions. By the use of these constructions, a noun and its participle may, by being placed either in the HGH or 9001 case, form a special kind of relative clause that conveys a sense of concur rent or immediately contiguous time relative to that of an independent clause. a. By far the more common of these usages is in the 1974 or

locative case. Its meaning is simply "while" or "when," and it may be formed freely with both active and passive participles. Examples: रामे वनं गच्छति सर्वे जना दुःखिता अभवन् । (When Rāma was going to the forest, all the people were unhappy.)

सीतायां तं पश्यन्त्यां कैकेय्यहसत् । (While Sitā was watching him, Kaikeyī laughed.) सर्वेषु जनेषु दुःखितेषु सत्सु देवा अपि विषण्णा भवन्ति । (When all the people are unhappy, even the gods become dejected.)

रामेण हन्यमानेषु राक्षसेषु वानरा आनन्देनानृत्यन् । (When the demons were being killed by Rāma, the mon keys danced for joy.)

i.

The same construction may be used with other participles, for example; तस्मिन्हते राक्षसे सर्वे जना भयमुक्ता अभवन् । (When that raksasa was killed, all people became free from fear.)

266

b. An exactly parallel usage to the ara H it may be formed

from the 901, or genitive case. This usage, called the Ha: षष्ठी, is somewhat less common than the सति सप्तमीalthough its function is quite similar. It too indicates simultaneous action. Its occurrence, however, is occasionally restricted to cases in which the action expressed by the genitive par ticiple is carried on not only at the same time as the action expressed by a finite verb (or equivalent) but in spite of it. As this construction is used to indicate action that is in some way disrespectful or contemptuous, it is called

TAIG9001, or genitive of disrespect. Examples: पश्यतो रावणस्य रामो राक्षसान्हन्ति । (Rāma kills the rākşasas (despite the fact that) Rāvana is looking on; i.e., Rāma kills the rākṣasa-s right before Rāvana's eyes.)

राज्ञो भाषमाणस्य कैकेय्यहसत् । (Kaikeyi laughed while the king was speaking.)

c. Note that both absolutive constructions are used only when

the subjects of the two clauses are not the same. 15.12 Special problems

One of the most elementary but frequently occurring errors that students commit with regard to the ad कृदन्त is due to the fact that in many instances the various cases of a participle of a given root may be homonymous with finite forms of the same root. A glance through the paradigm will indicate where confusion is possible. a. The most common instance of this should be considered

separately. It happens that the HH, ga, giay or नपुंसकालिङ्ग of the परस्मैपद वर्तमाने कृदन्त of roots belonging to the 37 7-s has exactly the same form as the extremely common 979459, 300, RA4G of the HH

267

Since, because of the common occurrence of the ala 97 (15.11.a), the former form occurs relatively frequently, the opportunities for confusion are not rare. To avoid this confusion, be sure, when dealing with an apparently finite verbal form, that you can identify the subject of the verb and that there are no "suspicious locatives" in its vicinity. Example: रामे वनं गच्छति सर्वे दुःखिता भवन्ति । Do not simply assume that Toofd is a finite form. If it were, you would have to find a subject. 274, of course, cannot be the subject of any finite form. Even if you were to assume an unexpressed subject, you would have to explain TH. Keeping in mind the HR a eliminates the difficulty. i. One should note in this connection that the confusion,

common among beginners, of the post-consonantal forms of and 37 (viz., and l) can prove particularly troublesome here.

EXERCISES

Translate the reading up until the sentence beginning a

T. Identify all the act G-s in A. Rewrite the reading, sub stituting relative clauses or other paraphrases for the acha

IGR1-s. Translate the remainder of the reading and carry out the same procedure as in B. Translate the following sentences into Sanskrit, using a nd

GRI-s and absolute constructions whenever possible. 1. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa killed rākṣasa-s in the forest while

(despite the fact that) the king of the rākşasa-s was watch ing. (V421 [4P])

268

2. When the king speaks, everyone stands listening. 3. The guru stands among the students who are reading books. 4. I cannot see the book that is being read by you. 5. When who is slain, do the people become free from fear? Now rewrite the sentences of D., substituting relative clauses for the participles. Translate and memorize the following two verses.

कूजन्तं राम रामेति मधुरं मधुराक्षरम् । आरुह्य कविताशाखां वन्दे वाल्मीकिकोकिलम् ।।

वाल्मीकेर्मुनिसिंहस्य कवितावनचारिणः । शृण्वनामकथानादं को न याति परां गतिम् ।।

Note: These two verses are based upon figures of speech called समस्तरूपक-s, or compound-metaphors, in which the subject of comparison (e.g., als Hilt:) is compared to the object of com parison (e.g., कोकिलः) by making an appositional कर्मधारय compound (see 12.10.b) of which the former is the prior and the latter the final, member. Thus, the word dichilocalocs: means the "Vālmiki cuckoo," or "Vālmīki viewed poetically as a cuckoo." There are two such समस्तरूपक-s in the first verse and three in the second.

## 16 Non-गण Conjugations; The लट्, लङ्, and लुट् (Future System and the Conditional); कृत्य (Gerundive)

16.0

16.1

Thus far, all the finite verbal forms you have learned, with the exception of the artifot yet, have involved knowledge of the

10, or conjugation class, to which each US, or verbal root, belongs. These forms, the C, MS, and fuss are, more over, the only finite forms generated according to these M-s. The remaining verbal conjugations, then, whatever their own peculiarities, do not require that you know the m of a root in order to generate their forms. सेट, वेट, and अनिट् Roots With regard to the non-M conjugations, all Sanskrit roots may be classified according to whether or nor they require the vowel 5 between themselves and tense markers or endings that begin with any consonant except 7. Since I is an exception, the issue does not arise with regard to the कर्मणि प्रयोग. a. This particular is called by the Sanskrit grammar

ians, and all roots are then classified as # (with 5) or roots that require the 3 wherever possible, 3 Pc (without 56), roots that do not require 5, and ac, or roots that op tionally take the 3. The 31fe roots are rather more numer

ous than the others. b. It is this distinction that explains the seemingly sporadic

occurrence of the 5 before the agentive suffix - and the infinitive ending -तुम्.

The rules for which roots belong to which categories are complex and need not be learned at this point. The dis tinction, however, is an important one. Its existence should therefore be kept in mind. If this is done, the verbal forms

274

16.2

themselves, when learned, will show clearly the presence or absence of the 5. This will be seen, for example, in the

case of the cac conjugation introduced below. H14R C ATO E : The Simple Future Thus far, although you have learned several modes of verbal forms indicating "present time" and numerous ways of indi cating preterite or "past” time, you have learned no straight forward way of expressing future time. Sanskrit has several ways of doing this. The simplest, which may be used to indi cate immediate future, is simply to use the MC, or present in dicative. Example: भो बालक वनं गच्छ । तथास्तु गच्छामि । (Hey boy! Go to the forest. So be it. I (will] go.)

16.3

On the other hand, for more general expression of future time, Sanskrit has two distinct verbal conjugations. The most im portant of these and the one more frequently used is also the simplest. It is called सामान्यभविष्यत्काले लट्, or"लट् in the sense of general future time." The term HIHR1, "ordinary, general," is used by the grammarians in an attempt to distinguish the usage of this form from that of the other future (see 16.11), but in fact no such distinction is observed in the literature. Formation of the ac a. The stem is formed by the suffixation to a verbal root,

of the tense marker -24. i. Before this markera root vowel takes 2° if capable of it. ii. In case of # roots, and optionally in the case of ac

roots, the tense marker is preceded by the vowel 5. In this case the # of the marker is changed to (3.58). The future stems of such roots then typically end in

-Grey iii. To the future stems thus formed are added the same

primary endings used with the लट्.

275

iv. The final 37 of a 2 stem is treated just like the final

37 of any 34--141 stem. Examples: Root

लट् forms Va (P) (give) Greifa (he will give) V17H (P) (go) facut (I will go) 144. (A) (think) tient (they will think)

Va (P) (do) sert: (we will do) v. 10th Tu roots form the 2 from the present stem. All

10th गण roots are सेट. Examples: VER (P) (steal) arproefa (he will steal) चिन्त् (P) (think) चिन्तयिष्यामि (I will think)

16.4

Derfor print of the ac The 2<, like most conjugations, has corresponding 04101 and Ha seri-s. But, like all conjugations not formed from the present stem, the ¢ has no special for or a stem. The कर्मणि and भावे प्रयोग-s then, are distinguished only by the fact of their always requiring the 31764-146 endings. In the case of roots ( -s) ordinarily conjugated in the 3116H146, there is no difference between corresponding कर्तरि and कर्मणि or भावे प्रयोग forms. Examples: Root VEEN (1P)(stay) <TH ad finua paik)

147 # FEIRA (Ha). (Rāma will stay in the forest)

VESY(A) (gain) a festa e (alle) (fl)

(He will gain nothing; Nothing will be gained.)

16.5

सन्धि and the लट् The formation and usage of the C2C are so simple and regular that they present few difficulties. There are, however, a few

276

U rules and other sound changes that should be noted here. Some of these have been introduced before but are repeated so as to refresh your memory. a. 3111c roots ending in consonants present a number of in

stances of internal consonant Hmu since no vowel inter venes between their final consonants and the of the 2 marker. Before of the future tense marker: i. Voiced E421-s change to their corresponding non-voiced

F43f-s. Example: Root

लट् VAG (split)

भेत्स्य ति (he will split)

ii. Aspirate F4Rf-s are changed to their corresponding non

aspirates and rule i., if necessary, applies. Example: Root Va (obtain, gain) hera (he will obtain)

iii. cipou consonants and are changed to hand the is

changed to 9 (7.18.c). Examples: Root 1245. (abandon)

त्यक्ष्यति (he will abandon) दृश् (see)

द्रक्ष्यति (he will see)

(see 16.5.b.i) Vवच् (say)

वक्ष्यति (he will say) VGE (burn)

& (compare 7.26.b)

(he will burn)

iv. 7 of several roots, most notably vaa (1P) (dwell), is

changed to a. Example: Root

लूट Van (dwell)

वत्स्य ति (he will dwell)

277

b. Several other sound changes are to be noted.

i. In the 2c and some other forms requiring vowel

strength, like the infinitive (13.1.a), a few roots with medial # show instead of the regular ju i.e., 37).

Examples: Root Vदृश् (see)

द्रक्ष्यति (he will see) VEST (emit, create) fa (he will create) v (move, creep)

a (he will move)

लट्

ii. A few roots are strengthened by a penultimate nasal.

Example: Root

लट् VAZ (4P) (perish) 75&fà (he will perish)

16.6

लट् of Some Important Roots Learning the following examples will give a sense of the eas ily recognizable form of theç of some common roots. a. 3tfore roots are more common than a (and ) roots. Some

typical examples are: Vदा (give) दास्यति (he will give) VEET (stand)

स्थास्यति (he will stand) VETI (know)

ज्ञास्यति (he will know) V215 (leave) त्यक्ष्यति (he will leave)

दृश (see)

(he will see) Vलभ् (get) लस्यते

(he will get)

द्रक्ष्यति

b. HC roots, however, are quite common and include some

that you must remember. v (do) करिष्यति (he will do) Vų (be) भविष्यति (he will be) VT (go) गमिष्यति (he will go) हिन् (kill) हनिष्यति (he will slay)

278

For at roots, of course, two forms are possible. Thus: निश् (perish) नक्ष्यति/नशिष्यति (he will perish) Vक्षम् (pardon) शंस्यति/क्षमिष्यति (he will pardon)

16.7

The following sentences illustrate the use of the future:

किं भविष्यति किं भविष्यतीति चिन्तयन्तः सर्वे शिष्याः परीक्षाशालामुद्विजन्त

आगमिष्यन्ति । (Thinking, "What will be? What will be?" all the students will come, trembling, to the examination hall.) यद्यहं जनकतनयां त्यक्ष्यामि तर्हि कस्मिन्नगरे स्थास्यतीत्यवश्यं मस्यते रघुकुलनन्दनः । (The bringer of joy to Raghu's race will certainly think, "If I abandon the daughter of Janaka, in what city will she stay?'')

मरणानन्तरं कुत्र गमिष्यति राक्षसः । यत्र न किमपि द्रक्ष्यति श्रोष्यति वा तत्र गमिष्यति । (Where will the rākşasa go after death? He will go where he will neither see nor hear anything.)

16.8

भविष्यत्काले कृदन्त : Future Participle A future participle may be made from the 2 stem in a way precisely analogous to the formation of the present participle of an अ गण stem (15.6). Examples: Root

Participle Stem vai (P) दास्यन्त

भू (P) भविष्यन्त युध् (A) योत्स्यमान Example: ग्रामं गमिष्यन् पुरुषो व्याघ्रमपश्यत् । (The man about to set off for the village saw the tiger.)279

16.9

16.10

अतिपत्तौ लङ् : The Conditional Classical Sanskrit has a special tense formation specifically reserved for hypotheses or situations contrary to fact. This is called 3ta4all 25, or "25 in the sense of nonexistence, non coming to pass (31104fet:)." This is actually of rather rare oc currence and is included here only because its formation, once the 2 is learned, presents no difficulty whatever. The 25 is formed from the future stem, exactly as the 5 (imperfect) is formed from the present stem. The stem is pre ceded by the augment 37 and followed by the appropriate sec ondary ending (8.9). A few examples will suffice: Root

लट् लङ् गम् (P) (go) गमिष्यति अगमिष्यत् (he would have gone) भाष (A) (speak) भाषिष्यते अभाषिष्यत (he would have spoken) Vत्यज् (P) (leave) त्यक्ष्यति अत्यक्ष्यत् (he would have left)

The form, when it occurs, is used in reference to situations that are hypothetical or that are flatly contrary to fact. Example: रामर्थतवाभविष्यद्रावणः सीतां नैवाहरिष्यत् । (If Rāma had been there, Rāvana would not have abducted Sītā.)

16.11 386 ( a) Hoteles ce : The Periphrastic Future

The second of the two future formations is considerably less common. Its formation is peculiar in that it is periphrastic, or made up of two distinct forms. One of these forms is nominal and one verbal. This peculiarity is enhanced by the fact that in the most frequently used person, the gems, the finite verbal

form is omitted. 16.12 Formation of the e

a. The C of a given verbal root, except in the ho form,

consists of a sequence of: i. an agentive noun derived from the root, ii. the IT form of the root V377 (2P) (be) agreeing in

number and person with the one of the root.

n

SOI

280

b. The agentive noun is formed by the addition of the suffix

- to the root, strengthened by Ju. The formation of the noun is discussed at 10.0-3. Its use is as follows. i. Its प्रथमा एक° पुंलिङ्ग form (ending in-ता) is used for all

मध्यम and उत्तमपुरुष forms regardless of number and gender. a. Examples: Root Agentive Noun

(8P) (do) कर्तृ → कर्ता गम् (1P) (go) गन्तृ → गन्ता Vभू (1P) (be) भवितृ → भविता

b. मध्यम and उत्तमपुरुष forms:

Root

कु कर्तास्मि (कर्ता + अस्मि)

गन्तासि (गन्ता + असि) Vभू भवितास्वः (भविता + स्वः)

(I will do) (you will go) (we two will be)

ii. प्रथमपुरुष forms differ from those of the other persons

in that the finite form of 375 is normally omitted. Since without this form it is impossible to indicate number, the remaining agentive noun normally takes its proper number. Examples: Root

कि कर्ता (he will do) गिम् गन्तारौ (they [2] will go)

भू भवितारः (they will be) Only context can help you distinguish these future

forms from the normal use of the agentive nouns. The complete paradigm of VaL would be:

एक द्वि बहु० प्रथम भविता भवितारौ भवितारः मध्यम° भवितासि भवितास्थः भवितास्थ उत्तम भवितास्मि भवितास्वः भवितास्मः

16.13

281

16.14

16.15

The e has no modes and occurs only in the RATYE , regard less of the conjugation of the underlying root. The is called 37841 (“not today') or BFT ("pertaining to tomorrow") to distinguish it from the more general C. This distinction, however, has not remained clear in the classical language. Example: हे सीते रामलक्ष्मणौ श्वो वनं गन्तारौ । त्वमपि गन्तासि वा न वा । (Oh Sītā, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa will go to the forest tomorrow. Will you too go or not?)

16.16

24 : The "Gerundive” or Prescriptive Passive Participle The "gerundive” (not to be confused with the "gerund" of 11.5) is yet another of those extremely useful “verbal adjectives" that we call participles. This particular participle is like the Ta कृदन्त of a कर्मणि or भावे application as it requires the कर्तृ of the action or state expressed by its verbal root to be in the daten fauft. It is not uncommon, however, to find the pool of a ge rundive in the 981. The participle, itself, is, when formed from a H ot root, in agreement with its . Moreover, it is "pre scriptive" in that the form indicates that the tale (thing modi fied) of this adjectival form is to be, should be, ought to be the object (where an object is possible) of the action or state expressed by the verbal root. Its force is very similar to that of the fara Rosor optative mode. Examples: ब्राह्मणो न केनापि हन्तव्यः । (A brāhman is not to be killed by anyone.)

नार्यपि न कदापि हन्तव्या । (A woman, too, is never to be killed.)

oma

रामेण राज्यं करणीयम् । (Rāma should rule the kingdom.)

282

महाभारतं दुर्विज्ञेयं देवैरपि । (The Mahābhārata is hard to understand, even for the gods.)

तन्न वक्तव्यं न मन्तव्यमपि । (That is not to be said, not even thought.)

तन्न मम कार्यम् । (I don't have to do that.)

a. The gerundive of 3744 roots is a participial equivalent

of the Harl. As such, its pe, if expressed, must be in the तृतीया (or षष्ठी) while the form itself, having no कर्मन् with which to agree, must be 9941, 306, H . Examples:

अत्र मया स्थातव्यम् । (Lit.,) (It is to be stayed here by me.) (I ought to stay here.)

भवतु । मया गन्तव्यम् । (Very well, I must go.)

न कस्यापि गन्तव्यम् । सर्वेषां स्थातव्यम् । (No one is to leave. Everyone must stay.)

i.

The gerundive of the root v4 is used idiomatically to indicate likelihood or probability. Here, as in other uses of the copula, the subject must be in the same case as its predicates. The case here is gaitei. Example: तेन राज्ञा भवितव्यम् । (He must be king.)

ii. The form Hacout by itself is frequently used in con

versation and dramatic dialogue in the sense of “very

likely," "probably," "undoubtedly,” etc. The gerundive, because of its prescriptive nature, can be used as a polite imperative with a TERI form of one of the 2nd person pronouns expressed or implied.

16.17

283

Examples: आगन्तव्यम् । (Come!)

गन्तव्यं यदि नाम निश्चितम् । (Go! If you have made up your mind.)

न भेतव्यं न भेतव्यम् । मयीह तिष्ठति न को ऽपि भयमनुभवतु । (Do not fear, do not fear. While I stand here, let no one experience fear.)

यद्यद्रोचते तद्ग्राह्यम् । यद्यन्न रोचते तत्त्याज्यम् । (Take what you like, leave what you don't.)

16.18 Gerundives, like other adjectives, may sometimes become

nouns.

Examples: vकृ → कार्यम् (duty, what is to be done)

पा → पेयम् (beverage, what is to be drunk.)

16.19

Formation of the Gerundive The gerundive may be formed from most roots by the addition of one of the following three suffixes: -य -तव्य -अनीय

The rules for treatment of roots before these suffixes are as follows: a. The suffix -य

The rules for the treatment of root vowels before - are complex and, unusually for Sanskrit, allow a good deal of freedom.

284

i. Root final vowels

a. final 31 always becomes .

Examples:

py (to be known) vपा

(to be drunk)

ज्ञा

b. final vowels other than 371 are treated variously.

They may be unchanged, subject to 1", or (less commonly) to is. In some cases, the same root

may show optionally any of these alternatives. c. If the vowel is subjected to ju or alco, then the

strengthened vowel may if I ore and must if 377 or 317 be treated as though it preceded a vowel (see 3.11). Thus: E → or 314

+ or 314

→ 379 377 → 31tą

Î

Examples: Root Gerundive VEG FRA / FRY (1) भू भव्य (T)

भाव्य (c)

(to be conquered) (to be)

d. If a final short vowel is not strengthened then the

consonant a often intervenes between the vowel and the suffix - (cf. 11.7.b.ii). Examples: VF files (to be conquered) Vaba gora (to be done)

ii. Root medial vowels

a. medial 37 is unchanged in some roots and length

ened in others.

285

b.

Examples: Root Gerundive

गम् गम्य (to be gone [to]) V225 21154 (to be abandoned) medial इ, उ, or a vowels are unchanged in some roots and subjected to qui in others. Examples:

द्विष् द्वेष्य (to be hated) युध योध्य (to be fought) Vगुह् गुह्य (to be hidden)

b.

Don't worry about the vagueness of these rules. You will come to recognize the common forms

with practice. The suffix -तव्य This extremely common suffix is added in each case to the same stem that precedes the-of the infinitive (13.1), or the agentive suffix -तृ (10.0). Examples:

भवितव्य (probably) कर्तव्य

(to be done) Vवच्

वक्तव्य

(to be said) मन्तव्य

(to be thought) गन्तव्य

(to be gone) पठ् पठितव्य (to be read) दा

दातव्य

(to be given) Vभुज

भोक्तव्य

(to be eaten)

मन्

Vगम्

The suffix -अनीय In general, root vowels are subject to put before this suffix, which is rather less common than the other two. Examples:

करणीय (to be done)

286

गम्

16.20

गमनीय

(to be gone) रिक्ष

रक्षणीय

(to be protected) Many roots, especially those ending in long 371, do not

form gerundives with this suffix. The difference of suffix does not change the meaning or use of the form. As can be seen from the above, one root may have several gerundives because of the three suffixes and the vari ety of forms possible before the suffix. On the other hand, not all roots actually occur with all suffixes, and in any case par ticular forms are often preferred. Examples:

कृ कृत्य, कार्य, कर्तव्य, करणीय जि जित्य, जेय, जय्य, जेतव्य भू भव्य, भाव्य, भवितव्य

16.21 Roots that only occur in the present system (e.g., 1921 [1P]

[see] and Vबू [2P] [say]) do not form gerundives or other non present participles.

## 17 परोक्षभूते लिट् (The Perfect); The Perfect Participle

17.0

17.1

17.2

The foc, or “perfect," is the last of the finite verbal conjuga tions in very frequent use. Like the 5, it functions as a simple narrative past. The term “perfect,” like the term "imperfect," was given to the form by Western philologists and has no sig nificance with regard to "aspect" or duration of action or states expressed The traditional Indian grammatical texts do attempt to distin guish the functions of the two forms (5 and foc). They say that the expresses 3PERA , or past time (not today) that was witnessed directly by the speaker, while the foc ex presses Ra l , (past time not directly perceived) an action not witnessed by the speaker. In fact, however, as is the case with all parts of the verbal system (cf. 16.15, etc.), such dis tinctions are not generally maintained in actual usage. The me, then, is used as yet another simple preterite tense. Thus, the following sentences all mean the same thing. (No translation, it is to be hoped, is necessary.) रामो वनं गच्छति स्म । (लट्) रामो वनमगच्छत् । (1951) रामो वनं गतः । (भूते कृदन्त) रामो वनं गतवान् ।

dag or ‘past active participle') रामो वनं जगाम । (fic) Use of the fore The general use of the fore, then, requires no particular com ment. a. It might, however, be noted here that by an extension of

the grammarians' prescription of the form for a time, poetic (and pedantic) usage may reserve the 3774464 forms of the foc for actions of which the speaker (who is also the

294

subject) has no clear recollection, or is unconscious. Such usage is, of course, rare. Example: उन्मत्त इव बह प्रललप राजसमीपे । (I prattled on like a drunkard in the presence of the king.)

b. The foc also has a few stereotyped usages. When in epic

or purāņic texts a new speaker is introduced, this is gener ally marked by his or her name or title and the appropriate forç of the root vaz. Examples: <TH 34 (Rāma said) 77474 377 (the rși-s said)

Commentators on texts often use the root V3T6 (say), which occurs only in the fore, to suggest or paraphrase what the author on whose work they are commenting is going to say. Thus: GHIGIE 14: H IGCE 1 (“What did Rāma do after going to the forest?” He (i.e., the author] now says.) At the end of some purāņic texts, the Ten oso port of V374 is used to indicate the end of a narrative. The phrase used is sta zla (a + 3 + 311H) (Thus it was...). The phrase in time has become a noun ŞRETH: (m) (history,

chronicle, legend, or story). -- Formation of the लिट

The forms of the forc, however, present a wide and initially intimidating variety of phonological and morphological con tingencies. These need not be memorized immediately. It is important, however, to leam to recognize foc forms and how to generate some of the more important ones. This is made much simpler by the fact that, within certain limits of varia tion, most forms exhibit one or more of a number of typical and easily recognizable characteristics. These signs are:

295

17.5

17.6

a. The use of 382H (reduplication) in the formation of the

लिट् stem. b. Characteristic strong-weak alternation in the foc stem. c. Special personal endings. All of these features involve a certain amount of irregularity which will be discussed separately under each heading.

अभ्यास : Reduplication The most characteristic feature of the “perfect" system is that virtually all its stems are formed by the peculiar process known as 372|18. This is the same process introduced in connection with the third of the present system (7.22-25). In fact, the particular rules for fort 37211H are much the same as those for the third 14. There are, however, some differences and some additional rules. Only the latter are detailed below, so review carefully the rules for the formation of present stems of the third 74 a. Treatment of consonants

Root consonants are treated just as in the present stems of the third ". Note, however, that the consonant of the root vf (conquer) and the consonant of the root vel (kill) are changed to quod (velar) sounds in the root por tion of the fort stems. Examples: root Rose VEST (1P) SHIRT (he conquered) VET (2P) 5781 (he killed)

b. Treatment of root medial and final vowels

i. Root vowel + always becomes 37 in the 3121H syl

lable (cf.7.23.b). Examples: root või (do) PAR (he did) Vu (bear) HR (he bore) (cf. faut (@])

लिट्

296

ii. Other non-initial root vowels reduplicate as in the

present stems of the third 1, but a very important exception, which must be learned immediately, is that the root v4 has as its 37 , so that its foc stem is a

(see 17.9.a below). iii. Certain common roots beginning with a (and in the

case of 451, 9) followed by a single final consonant (cf.9.27.d) are subject in several forms to a distinctive weakening. This process is known as HYHRY These roots, e.g., Vaz, vag, vay, val, vall, Vae, and V451, take respectively their YARU vowel (i.e., 3 or 3) as their 3p2iH syllables. This, in turn, is prefixed to the full (or strengthened) grade of the root in strong forms (see 17.8.f). In weak forms, however, the root, too, is subject to Haru and the contact of the two similar short vowels yields the corresponding long vowel (3.3). Root Strong foc form Weak for form Vaa (P) (say) 3918 (he said) 1: (they said) यज् (P) इयाज (he sacrificed) ईजुः (they sacri

(sacrifice)

ficed)

c.

Treatment of root initial vowels i Roots with initial vowels may form the reduplicated

I only if the syllable of the root is (light). San skrit syllables are considered either ? (light) or 5 (heavy) depending on the nature of their vowel. a. Long vowels, vowels, and any vowels that

immediately precede a consonant cluster, अनुस्वार,

or विसर्ग are गुरु (cf. 7.16). b. Short vowels, unless they precede a cluster, 37gfar,

or fahrt, are my. Roots with a les vowel (as in i. above) in initial position do not form a redupli cated fat but have a corresponding form, the

297

periphrastic perfect, which is treated below (17.18). The only exception to this rule is the root V3119 (5P) (obtain), which forms a reduplicated forç

as though from a root V*374. ii. Root initial short vowels

a. The vowel 31 (and the 311 of V3114) are redupli

cated, and the result of the contact of the two vowels is, of course, 31. Examples: V374 (P) (be) 311A (he was) V3E (P) (say) 31 (he said)

V3114 (P) (obtain) 3114 (he obtained) b. Initial 5 and 3 are likewise reduplicated, but the

coalescence of the two short vowels to a long oc curs only in weak forms (see 17.13). In strong forms: 1. the root vowel is subject to M, and 2. the 31218 is separated from it by its corre

· sponding semi-vowel. Example: Root Strong foc Weak fase Vइष (wish) इयेष (wished) ईषुः (they wished)

17.7

c. Do not worry about roots beginning with . There are two important exceptions to the rules regarding 3p24|TH. a. If a root fulfills all of the criteria listed below, then in weak

forms only (see 17.13), it is subject to the phenomena of i. 31214014 (loss of reduplication), and ii. Tra (change of medial 37 to 9).

The criteria are: 1. The root must be of the form consonant-vowel

consonant with both consonants simple (i.e., not part of a cluster).

298

2. The vowel must be 31. 3. In general, the first consonant must be one which

is not altered in 372H (i.e., it must not be aspirate,

48 (velar) or 5. Examples: Root Strong

Weak Vतप् (be hot) तताप (he was तेपुः (they were

heated)

heated) V274 (curse) R14 (he cursed) TTY: (they cursed) आपत् (fall) पपात (he fell) पेतुः (they fell)

4. Some roots, however, will optionally undergo

अभ्यासलोप and एत्वम्,even though theydo not con form to the rules above. Examples: 1964 (to bear fruit) sex (they bore fruit) VHS (to share) #5: (they shared)

17.8

b. The root Vac (2P), “know," has no 372114 in its foc

forms. Furthermore, the form is commonly used as a present tense; calca GER a daga va doi: 1 A la Audi (All this [world) is truly Brahman. Who knows this, he alone is a knower of essential truth. He

will gain liberation.) Stem strength in the forme The perfect is exactly like the non-37 M-s of the present sys tem in its general distinction of strong and weak forms (7.9, 10). Here, too, the Tobach Hi4G forms are strong, while the others (द्विवचन and बहुवचन परस्मैपद and all the आत्मनेपद forms) are weak. a. In general, as with the present system, the distinction is

maintained by a strengthening of the root vowel of the strong forms while the weak forms retain the root vowel in its original grade.299

17.9

VO

i. This does not pertain to root initial 31. For the rules

governing other root initial vowels, see 17.6.c.ii. It is characteristic of roots with a final vowel that among the strong forms themselves there is a regular alternation of root vowel strength. The system of root final vowel strength in the strong forms is: Form

Vowel Strength प्रथमपुरुष वृद्धि मध्यमपुरुष गुण उत्तमपुरुष

गुण or वृद्धि Examples:

प्रथम

मध्यम

उत्तम vकृ (do) चकार

चकर / चकार भी (fear)

बिभाय बिभेथ

बिभय / बिभाय

चकर्थ

a. The extremely important root v4, however, is irregular in

this regard. Its root vowel is unstrengthened and is set off from vowel endings by its corresponding semi-vowel -व् (for irregular अभ्यास, seel7.6.ii above). . Example:

प्रथम०

मध्यम

उत्तम भू (be) बभूव

बभूविथ बभूव

17.10

b. For the treatment of root final 371, see 17.14.b. Root medial 31, which occurs very frequently, follows the anal ogy of root-final vowels in the strong forms. That is, it takes वृद्धि (=length) in the प्रथमपुरुष, गुण (=no change) in the मध्यम and optionally, गुण or वृद्धि in the उत्तम. Since roots with medial 37 are so common, their forms are among the most typical of the foc. The rhythm of the strong forms, particularly of the प्रथमपुरुष short-long-short (अ-आ-अ), is an easily recognizable sign of the perfects of the roots.

300

Examples: प्रथम

गम् (go) जगाम Vशक् (be able) शशाक

पत् (fall) पपात हिन् (kill) जघान

मध्यम जगमिथ शशक्थ पपतिथ जघन्थ

उत्तम जगम/जगाम शशक/शशाक पपत / पपात जघन /जघान

17.11

Other medial vowels are subject to qui in all strong forms Examples: Root

प्र एक VAG (split)

बिभेद Vकुप् (be angry) चुकोप

17.12 The above rules of stem strength in strong forms do not apply to

vowels which are गुरु (see 17.6.c.i). Such vowels take no strength and so their perfects do not exhibit the strong-weak distinction. Examples: Root

प्र० एक प्र° बहु Vचुम्ब् (kiss)

चुचुम्ब चुचुम्बुः (they kissed) निन्द् (rejoice) ननन्द

ननन्दुः (they rejoiced) 17.13 The weak forms usually show the root vowel with no change.

Examples: Root

Strong Weak vão (do)

चकार

चक्रुः (they did) छिद् (cut)

चिच्छेद

चिच्छिदिम (we cut)

However, a few roots with medial - 37-, but which, by reason of their first consonant's being subject to change in 37 , do not qualify for अभ्यासलोप and एत्वम् (17.7.a), show a weakening of their root vowel in the weak forms. This weakening, which has no bearing on the variable strength of the strong forms as shown at 17.10, involves the complete loss of the root vowel. The four most important roots that exhibit this phenomenon are Vहन् (kill), Vजन् (be bom), गिम् (go), and Vखन् (dig):

301

Examples:

गम् (P) रहन् (P) जिन् (A) Vखन् (P)

प्रथम एक

प्रथम बहु जगाम (he went) जग्मुः (they went) जघान (he killed) जघ्नुः (they killed) जज्ञे (he was born) जज्ञिरे (they were bom) चखान (he dug) चख्नुः (they dug)

17.14 The लिट् endings are as follows:

परस्मैपद एक द्वि बहु प्र° -अ [औ] -अतुः । -: म° -थ -अथुः -अ उ० -अ [औ) -व -म

एक -ए -से -ए

आत्मनेपद द्वि. बहु -आते -[इ) रे -आथे -ध्वे -वहे -महे

a. The PETG endings are generally peculiar to the perfect.

Only-व, -म, and-3: are the same as the corresponding sec ondary (e.g., लङ् or लिङ्) endings. On the other hand, the 311646146 endings are the same as the corresponding pri mary (e.g., लट्) endings-with the exception of the प्रथम एक and बहुवचन. It is important that you learm the प्रथमपुरुष endings at once. The bracketed ending -औ is the regular प्रथम° and उत्तम, एक° परस्मैपदending forroots with final आ (and, more rarely, संयुक्त vowels).

Examples: Root

प्रथम / उत्तम एक परस्मैपद Vया (go)

ययौ (he/I went) स्था(stand)

तस्थौ (he/I stood) VTTI (know)

जज्ञौ (he/ I knew) VGi (give)

ददौ

(he/I gave) Vपा (drink)

(he/ I drank)

(he/I sang) VET (place)

(he/I placed)

पपों

गै (sing)

जगा

दाभो

302

c.

These roots are also peculiar in that they lose their root vowels before any ending beginning with a vowel or pre ceded by the vowel 5. Example: Root

प्रथम बहु° परस्मैपद स्था

तस्थुः

17.15

These forms, particularly those ending in 3īt are also typi

cal and easily recognizable "perfect" forms. The foc endings that begin with consonants (-4,-2, -6, -7, -Ă, -E7, -, and -46) are, moreover, frequently separated from the perfect stem by the vowel 5. The application of this vowel, which is not wholly dependent upon whether the root in ques tion is अनिट, सेट, or वेट्, is summarized as follows: a. The gen , 46979, 3115H24G ending is always preceded

by ş. Since this rule has no exceptions, it is useful to re member this ending as -5? Examples: VAN → Hur (they spoke) VAI → HAR (they thought) (See 17.7.a.)

b. The मध्यमपुरुष, एकवचन, परस्मैपद ending -थ takes the s spo

radically. Many roots take it optionally, and in the case of those in final - 371, the root vowel is lost before it (17.14.c). For example: Root

→ Galer/afaa (you gave) c. The remaining six consonant-initial endings (-7, -H, -,

ta, -HE, and -26) may or may not take 5 but in practice almost always do so. Examples: Root

consonant endings VYN (Ā) CH1948 (we spoke)

303

VOTH (P)

pha (we two went) Vaa (P)

3faa (we two spoke) V40 (A)

Afta (you thought) (See 17.7.a.) d. Several roots ending in the vowels 3 and do not take the

ç except, of course, before-t. These roots are: (in 3)

(in ) VED (praise) V (do) VE (run, flow) V (bear) vę (flow) va (choose) VP (hear) VĘ (move) All of these roots are fairly common and some, like v and V, are extremely so. Examples:

(you did) चकृम (we did) शुश्रुव (we two heard)

चकर्थ

17.16

These, then, are the basic rules for the formation of the loc, Do not attempt at this point to memorize them all. Do, how ever, familiarize yourself with the varieties of formation and strength of the various perfect stems. Pay special attention to the basic types of foc sound patterns. Review these paragraphs several times. You should memorize all the gery endings with their typical forms for the types of roots mentioned above.

Some examples of the fore: वाल्मीकिरुवाच । यदा पिता स्वसुतविवर्णमुखं ददर्श तदा निःश्वसन्भूमौ निपपात। (Vālmīki said: “When the father saw the pale face of his own son, he fell sighing to the ground.")

17.17

भरतो राजा भविष्यतीत्युक्त्वा रामलक्ष्मणौ वनं जग्मतुः । (Having said "Bharata will be king," Rāma and Lakşmaņa went to the forest.)

304

वनं गत्वा श्रीरामचन्द्रो मुनिभ्यो ऽभयं ददौ । ततो दुष्टराक्षसानां शिरांसि सर्पदन्ततीक्ष्णशरैश्चिच्छेद । (Having gone to the forest, Sri Rāma gave fearlessness to the munis. Then he cut off the heads of the wicked rākşasas with arrows as sharp as serpents' teeth.)

तत एव राक्षसानां महाभयमुद्बभूव । यत्र यत्र तस्थतुर्वीतौ राघवौ तत्र तत्र निशाचरा बहु विलेपुः ।

(Because of that, great dread sprang up among the rākşasas. Wherever the two Rāghava heroes stood, there the rangers of the night (rākşasas) lamented greatly.)

तदनन्तरमन्यद्वनं जगाम रघुपतिः । तत्र च महातपस्तेपे सः । (Then the lord of the Raghus (Rāma) went to another forest. There he performed great austerities.)

17.18 Fre Continued: The Periphrastic Perfect

As mentioned at 17.6.c.i, roots of a certain phonological type do not form the ordinary reduplicated perfect. These are roots that have an initial vowel which is to either by nature (long or H ) or by position (preceding a conjunct consonant). Such roots are, in fact, relatively rare and of no great consequence. The form that they take that corresponds to the reduplicated foc, however, is of considerable interest because of its other * applications. This form is also called in by the grammarians. Western grammarians call it the periphrastic perfect. Like the periphrastic future (8C), it is made up of a fixed nominal and a

variable verbal form. 17.19 Formation of the Periphrastic Perfect

The formation of the periphrastic perfect is quite simple. The nominal element is formed by suffixing -3114 directly to the root. This form is then followed in the KE4C by the appro priate लिटof theroots अस्, Vकृ, or less often vy. In the आत्मनेपद, the auxiliary verb is the 31/64the form of vş only.

305

17.20

17.21

Thus, for example, for the roots V311A (2Ā), “sit,” and Veu (1A), "grow,” the प्रथम', एक', आत्मनेपद forms would be आसां चक्रे and एधां चक्रे. In theepic, Vआस् is sometimes taken as परस्मैपद, and so its foc form could be 31THATH, 3THER, or ca. The 9917°, CE, REAL would then be 3THIHNE: (-29, -:). The root V3114 is exempt from this formation (17.6.c.i.b). This form is also used instead of the reduplicated to for roots of the tenth 1. Here, however, the syllable -3714 is added, not to the root, but to the present stem. Examples: Root

Periphrastic perfect VERE (steal) Dehra (he stole)

चिन्त् (think) FarPHIE (he thought)

17.22 By this last technique (i.e., suffixation of -3114 to the present

stem) are formed the most significant occurrences of the peri phrastic fore, the perfects of the secondary conjugations. These

will be discussed in the following lesson. 17.23 The Perfect Participle

The se, like me and the 2c, has associated with it a verbal adjective. This one serves as a past active participle but is of extremely rare occurrence, being restricted in actual usage to a

very few verbal roots. 17.24

Its masculine stem is formed by adding the suffix -aid to the weak form of the perfect stem. Thus, Vops → paid. If this stem is monosyllabic, the ait is set off from the stem by the vowel 5 (but see a.): VETT → aferais (stood) Vay → alaih (heated) a. In fact, this form and its peculiar declension is of interest

mainly because a fairly common word, laat (learned or wise man), is, in form, a perfect participle. Like the finite for of the root viac, it loses both its reduplication and its past sense.

## 18 णिजन्त, सवन्त, and यङन्त Secondary Conjugations; नामधातु (The Denominative)

18.0

18.1

18.2

With one exception, the characteristic signs of the various con jugated systems introduced thus far are alike in that they are markers only of tense or mode. In other words, the ten signs of the 10-s (7.4ff.), the -R4 of the future (16.2ff.), and the 328 (reduplication) of the perfect (17.Off.) suffice only to mark the general conjugation to which a verbal form belongs. They do not tell us anything about the action expressed by a verbal root except, in general, the relative time of the action.

The one exception is the 7, characteristic of the cuffon eeter (9.5ff.). This, unlike the others, tells us that the sentence or clause in which it appears is "passive." This special "passive" sign, however, is applicable only to forms which mirror the present system. Secondary Conjugations In addition to the conjugations discussed so far, Sanskrit has four special conjugations that, like the an i , indicate some thing about the action of a verbal root other than its tense.

These forms are also like the ashifor stems in -4 in that they have a distinctive sign that is suffixed to a special form of the root to form a distinctive stem. They differ from the c on stems in and other present stems in that, in many cases, this distinctive secondary stem may serve as the basis for forma tions outside the present system. The secondary conjugations, then, are not tenses but special derivative stem formations that in turn are used, like verbal roots, as the basis for various con jugations. It is for this reason that these forms are said to be "secondary" conjugations. It is also for this reason that the forms are identified in Sanskrit by their special stem-forming suffixes:

18.3

314

18.4

णिजन्त (ending in णिच्), यङन्त (ending in यङ्), सनन्त (ending in सन्). The forms are discussed below in order of decreasing impor tance. fost ( ): The Causative This is by far the most frequently used and important of the secondary conjugations. It is referred to either by its charac teristic suffix (-37, which is called for by the grammarians, or by the name ("causer," "impeller") for its function. a. A MISTR verbal form indicates that its grammatical sub

ject causes someone or something to carry out or undergo the action or state expressed by the underlying verbal root. Causative sentences, then, involve two decs: the subject of the causative (i.e., derivative) verb and the subject of the simple verb or the action or state expressed by the un derlying verbal root. Take, for example, two sentences: रामो वनं गच्छति । (Rama goes to the forest.) and दशरथो राम

Thai (Dasaratha sends Rāma (causes Rāma to go) to the forest). In the first sentence <14: is, of course, the te of the root V-14 (go) as he is the agent, the goer. In the second sentence, however, the finite verb is 744a, which is formed not from VT4 but rather from 1944 (cause to go), the णिजन्त derivativeof गम्. The कर्तृ of this form is दशरथः. Rāma remains the one of the underlying root V774 as he is

still the one who does the actual going. कर्तृ-s of Underlying Roots

of a finite Tus form is treated exactly like that of any other finite verbal form. It is in the term a s if the form is a कर्तरि प्रयोग and in the तृतीया if it is a कर्मणि प्रयोग. The treatment of the dies of the underlying or simple verbal root, however, requires some explanation, especially as it is different depend

ing on the transitivity of the underlying root.

18.5

Th

315

a. अकर्मक धातु-s

With णिजन्त forms of अक तु-s, including verbs of mo tion (see 4.38,41), the कर्तृ of the underlying root is placed in the द्वितीया विभक्ति. The णिजन्त forms even of अकर्मक धातु-s are themselves सकर्मक. Examples: Underlying root गिम् (go)

दशरथो रामं वनं गमयति । (Dasaratha makes Rāma go to the forest.)

स्था

(stand)

सेवकः फलं स्वामिनो हस्ते स्थापयति । (The servant places a fruit in his

master's hand.)

पत्

(fally

(fall)

वानरा महावृक्षान्पातयन्ति । (The monkeys fell the great trees.)

Vवस्

(dwell)

को मां वने वासयिष्यति । (Who will make me dwell in the forest?)

भू

(be)

दशरथो रामं राजानं भावयति । (Dasaratha makes Rāma king.)

b. In the case of सकर्मक धातु-s, the कर्तृof the underlying root is

generally placed in the तृतीया विभक्ति, although the द्वितीया is sometimes encountered. Examples: Underlying root हिन् (kill) सुग्रीवो रामेण वालिनं घातयति ।

(Sugrīva has Rāma kill Vālin.)

Va

(do)

रामो भरतेन राज्यं कारयामास । (Rāma had Bharata rule the kingdom.)

316

Vai

(give)

{THIERRA 57 4141 (Let the king cause his attendants to give money to the people.)

i. Roots whose fuiste stems convey the senses of teach

ing, or feeding, are exceptions. With them the cost of the underlying root is placed in the ladtall. (See 18.10.a.iii.) Examples: गुरुः शिष्यान्पुस्तकानि पाठयति । (The guru has his students read the books.)

राजा बाह्मणं भोजयति । (The king feeds the brāhman.)

ii. The roots V31G (2P) (eat) and VAIG (1P) (eat) are ex

ceptions to the exception. The subjects of their derivatives, आदय् (feed) and खादय (feed) are in तृतीया. Example: हे सूत नृपाश्वैः खादय । (O charioteer, feed the king's horses.)

18.6

18.7

Formation of the for The formation of the fursa is quite simple. In general the causative marker (UEL) is suffixed directly to the root, which is usually strengthened. Because of additional strength of the & in various forms, it is simplest to regard the causative marker as-374. The rules for root-strength are as follows: a. Initial or medial short vowels (except 37), if in a my syl

lable (see 17.6.c.i), usually take tu. Examples: Root vay (1) (be awake) atera (awaken) Vaz (6) (enter) RR (cause to enter) Var24 (1) (be arranged) $644 (arrange)

णिजन्त

317

Some roots, however, have l' only optionally. Examples: VTH (1) (shine, 147/14 (make beautiful)

be beautiful)

b. Initial or medial vowels in J6 syllables (except 31) remain,

as elsewhere, unstrengthened. Example: Root

णिजन्त Vgra (1) (kiss) EFR (cause to kiss)

y syllable, is usually length

c. Medial or initial 31, if in a

ened. For example: Root V245 (1) (abandon) 198 (1) (read) V3TE (2) (eat) V6 (2) (kill)

णिजन्त त्याजय् (cause to abandon) 4184 (teach) आदय् (feed) ar (cause to kill) (Note irregular form)

i.

But a number of roots show no lengthening. Examples: V=TH (1) (go) 14 (cause to go) V517 (4) (be born) Joy (give birth to)

ii. In some cases both forms (i.e., with 37 and 311) are

citable from the same root. Examples:

Vopn (1) (step) 42/14 (cause to step) 1214 (4) (be still) 244/201424 (calm, extinguish)

d. Final simple vowels, except 311, are subject to cha

Examples: Root

णिजन्त VŲ (1) (be) 492 (cause to be)

318

Vē (8) V8 (5)

(do) (hear)

FR4 1974

(cause to do) (cause to hear, teach)

e. Final 371 (and a vowels) are generally set off from the

causative marker by the consonant 4. This is a character istic sign of the first forms of roots with such finals. For example: Root

णिजन्त Vhen (3) (stand)

F41144 (place) Va (3) (give) 6144 (cause to give) VEI (2) (bathe F1194 (bathe (transitive])

(intransitive]) VETI (9) (know) 3144 (inform)

A few roots show not the 4, buty, before the 12. Root

णिजन्त 19 (1) (drink) TRR (cause to drink)

:

18.8

f. The root vş (2) (go), which would form 3114 by rule d.,

instead forms 311421 (a common verb meaning teach) when

preceded by the 34701 3779 Forms of the णिजन्त Since the 11577 is a secondary or derivative verbal root, it is not restricted to any one conjugation but may be used fairly freely as the base for the various verbal systems. Note that except for the कर्मणि प्रयोग (18.10), the परस्मैपद endings aregen erally used for the causative, regardless of the voice of the simple root. The Present System The SR, may serve as the base for a complete present sys tem, exactly analogous to those of the 37 atu roots of the present stem, formed by suffixing 37 to the suffix -37%. Therefore, the fusta present stem is characterized by the sign -377 and is conjugated exactly like roots of the tenth (VF) 14. genye

18.9319

लट्

एकवचन forms of the णिजन्त of the root vस्था (stand) (stem स्थापय्) will suffice as an example:

स्थापयति (he places) लक

अस्थापयत् (he placed) लोट

स्थापयतु (let him place) विधि लिङ् स्थापयेत् (he should place) वर्तमाने कृदन्त स्थापयन्त् (placing)

18.10 The कर्मणि प्रयोग

A regular कर्मणि प्रयोग stem may be formed from the णिजन्त by replacing the causative sign -अय् with the regular कर्मणि प्रयोग sign - 4. This is added to the root strengthened as for the caus ative (18.7), including the consonant where required (18.7.e). As usual with the कर्मणि प्रयोग, the आत्मनेपद endings are used. Examples: Root

कर्तरि णिजन्त

कर्मणि णिजन्त स्था

स्थापयति

स्थाप्यते /गम्

गमयति

गम्यते Vलम्

लाभयति

लाभ्यते श्रावयति

श्राव्यते

Vश्रु

a. When transforming कर्तरि प्रयोग into कर्मणि प्रयोग, it is neces

sary to be aware of the different treatment accorded the कर्तृ-s of सकर्मक and अकर्मक धातु-s (18.5). i. अकर्मक धातु-s

णिजन्त forms of अकर्मक धातु-s are themselves सकर्मक. The कर्मणि प्रयोग is formed just as for a simple सकर्मक verbal form. For example: कर्तरि कन्या पक्षिणं पञ्जरे स्थापयति । कर्मणि कन्यया पक्षी पञ्जरे स्थाप्यते । (The girl places the bird in the cage.)

ii. सकर्मक धातु-s

सकर्मक धातु-s are treated similarly. Here the कर्मन् of the forsta (= the panel of the underlying root) is put into

320

the प्रथमा विभक्ति, while the कर्तृ of the णिजन्त goes into the तृतीया विभक्ति.

Example: कर्तरि सुग्रीवो रामेण [रामं वा] वालिनं घातयति । कर्मणि—सुग्रीवेण रामो वालिनं घात्यते । (Sugrīva has Rāma kill Vālin.)

iii. Roots whose 5 stems convey the senses of teach

ing or feeding, may optionally take their causal object (कर्मन् of the णिजन्त) in the प्रथमा विभक्ति or द्वितीया विभक्ति. In the first option, the 04f7 of the underlying root is placed in the द्वितीया विभक्ति; in the second option, it is placed in the प्रथमा विभक्ति. (See 18.5.b.i.)

Examples: कर्तरि— गुरुः शिष्यान्वेदान् पाठयति । कर्मणि— गुरुणा शिष्या वेदान् पाठ्यन्ते । कर्मणि गुरुणा शिष्यान्वेदाः पाठयन्ते । (The guru has the students study the Vedas.)

कर्तरि—राजा ब्राह्मणमोदनं भोजयति । . कर्मणि— राज्ञा ब्राह्मण ओदनं भोज्यते । कर्मणि राज्ञा ब्राह्मणमोदनो भोज्यते । (The king feeds the brāhman rice.)

18.11 Other Formations

In conjunction with the following forms, it is important to note "that causative stems are always सेट् (16.1.a). That is, they al ways have the vowel 5 between them and the endings of the non-present forms for which the 3If distinction is rel

evant. 18.12 भूते कृदन्त

The G and its counterpart the past active participle (in -तवन्त) are formed by the suffixation of the ending directly to the root, strengthened according to 18.7, plus the इट.

321

भूते कृदन्त स्थापित

Examples: Root VFETT (stand)

दृश् (see) VITH (go) VF (do) (कुप् (be angry)

दर्शित

गमित कारित कोपितवन्त्

(placed) (shown) (banished) (caused to be done) (angered (transitive])

18.13 Gerund

a. Without उपसर्ग

The normal ending -rall, preceded by the 5C, is added di rectly to the causative sign -37%. Examples: Root

Gerund VFI (stand) Felirical (having placed)

(do) crfurall (having caused to do) (see) दर्शयित्वा

(having shown) Vor (go)

Real (having banished) b. With उपसर्ग

The normal ending - replaces the causative sign. Examples: Root

Gerund अनु + कृ (imitate) अनुकर्य (having caused to imitate) प्रति + स्था (be firm) प्रतिष्ठाप्य (having established)

c. When roots with medial 37 that show no strength in the

for Sin (18.7.c.i) are preceded by an 3487f, the ending is added directly to the USR marker. Examples: Root

Gerund अव + गम् (understand) अवगमय्य (having caused to

understand) अनु + जन् (be born after) अनुजनय्य (having caused to be

born after)

322

18.14

Infinitive As with the gerund without उपसर्ग, the infinitive ending -तुम् preceded by the 5C is added to the causative marker. Examples: Root

Infinitive Ven (stand) स्थापयितुम् (to place) VE (kill) घातयितुम् (to kill)

274 (go)

गमयितुम् (to go)

18.15 Gerundive

a. -doo

Like-14 and -rall, the ending -Hou preceded by 5C is added to the causative sign. Examples: Root

Gerundive VEET (stand)

स्थापयितव्य (to be placed) V14 (go) to (to be made to go)

b.

effor seint the ending - 7 replaces the

7 Like the - 1 of the causative marker. Examples: Root VRET (stand)

014 (go)

Gerundive स्थाप्य (to be placed) गम्य (to be made to go)

-अनीय The ending -3714, like-4, replaces the causative marker: Examples: Root

Gerundive VETT (stand) Fenerife (to be placed) VITA (go) गमनीय (to be made to go)

323

18.16

2¢ The future sign -स्य preceded by the इट् (→ इष्य) is added to the causative marker. Examples: Root

लूट VEET (stand)

स्थापयिष्यति (he will place) Vore (go)

h oura (he will cause to go) VF (do) dorproefa (he will cause to do)

18.17

18.18

The nominal suffix - preceded by FC is added to the caus ative sign. For example: Root VEIT (stand) F214Pal (he will place)

गम् (go) गमयितास्मि (I will cause to go) The nominal element may also serve as an agentive noun. fot The causative may form only the periphrastic perfect and in fact, accounts for the great majority of the occurrences of this form in the language. The periphrastic perfect is formed from the causative stem exactly as from the few simple roots that must take this form (17.18). Examples: Root

Fen (stand) F ITH GT/GR) (he placed) V (do) Reha (tarar) (he caused to do)

(hear) PATH (T/E9R) (he caused to

hear, he taught)

लिट्

18.19 Uses of the forta

As can easily be seen, it is extremely useful to have a simple grammatical form that can remove the subject of a verb one step from the action of a verbal root by making that subject the agent who impels another subject to act. This useful form is

324

exploited often in Sanskrit. Keep in mind that, in many cases, the fort may be translated by a simple verb in English. Try to translate in this way whenever possible, avoiding such phrases "cause to" unless you feel that they are either stylisti cally sound, or unavoidable in English. Examples: V4 (4) (be angry) कोपयति (he angers) V9 (1) (fall) पातयति (he fells) VFaly (2) (sleep) स्वापयति (he puts to sleep) 198 (1) (read) पाठयति (he teaches) VA (5) (hear) श्रावयति (he announces, he

teaches) VERT (3) (stand) Fellefa (he puts, places) V5 (7) (eat)

भोजयति (he feeds) Va (9) (know)

ज्ञापयति (he informs)

a. The PTSR of the common root VI (tula) may, without

change of form, be used both actively and passively in the senses of: i. to cause to see; ii. to show (i.e., cause to be seen).

The second usage may or may not take the 3C46146 endings and is especially common when the idea of one's showing oneself or something of one's own is intended. Example: ऋषिभ्यः स्वं विश्वरूपं दर्शयित्वा महेश्वरः कैलासं ययौ । (Having manifested his cosmic form to the rşis, Maheśvara went to Kailāsa.)

18.20 HR: The Desiderative

The HERT, or desiderative, is another derivative stem formed quite freely from most roots and causative derivatives. The form is considerably less common than the fish and is, in fact, chiefly represented by two derivative nominal forms.

325

18.21

The HER indicates that the subject of the form desires to do or experience the action or state expressed by the underlying root. It may be paraphrased by the infinitive of the simple root with an appropriate form of V54, etc. Examples:

रामो वनं जिगमिषति । = 1 Tagfold i (Rāma wants to go to the forest.)

भवतां सेवां चिकीर्षामि ।

NGHỈ Hai chinesIf I (I want to serve you (lit., do your service).)

Ses

18.22 Formation of the DER

The form is made by suffixing the characteristic desiderative sign-H (called HF by the grammarians), preceded in some cases by the 5€ to a verbal root. The 5C occurs more or less as it does with the infinitive. The rules regarding formation are for your reference. You need not memorize them. a. Before this sign (-8 or -54), the root is subject to 3pIH.

i. Thereduplication of consonants is mostly the same as

with the third गण and लिट् (7.22). ii. The treatment of vowels is somewhat different:

a. अ, आ, ऋ,ऋ,and इ,ई vowels all appear in the अभ्यास

syllable as 5. Examples: Root

सनन्त Stem VE (do)

Pacate (wish to do) VTH (go)

faring (wish to go) जि (conquer) जिगीष (wish to conquer)

(See 18.22.b.v.)

b. For # vowels when preceded by a labial conso

nant reduplicate as 3.

326

Example: VĘ (die)

en

(wish to die)

c. 3,37, vowels appear as 3 in the 372H syllable.

Example: VL (be) बुभूष (wish to be)

b. The root syllable itself is usually unchanged, but:

i. Final 5 and 3 are lengthened before 8.

Example:

Ves (conquer) srity (wish to conquer) ii. Final For becomes & or before a.

Examples:

कु (do) चिकीर्ष (wish to do)

(cross) fants (wish to cross) मृ (die)

(wish to die)

मुमूर्ष

iii. 5, 3, and #vowels always, when final, and optionally

when medial, take yo before -54. Example: Vवृध् (grow) विवर्धिष (wish to grow)

iv. Some roots with final -371 or -374 lengthen their root

vowel. Examples:

मन् (think) मीमांस (wish to think) (Note irregular lengthening of reduplicated vowel.) VE (kill)

fraih (wish to kill)

(See 18.22.b.v) V. Some initial al zou-s and show reversion in the root

syllable to puo-s after the 373 syllable. Examples: VEL (kill) feia (wish to kill)

(See 1.22.b.iv.)

327

जिगीष

(wish to conquer)

VEG (conquer) but VTI (know)

BISITA

(wish to know)

vi. A few roots, notably V3114 (obtain), va (give), and

VUT (place), have peculiarly contracted forms of 37218 and root. These forms are $79 (desire to obtain), fach

(desire to give), and the desire to place), respectively. All HER stemsend in 37 and are treated exactly like 37 pul stems in the present system. Examples:

Root लट्

लोट vo (do) fastera चिकीर्षत

अचिकीर्षत (he wishes (let him wish (he wished to do) to do)

to do) विधि लिङ्

वर्तमाने कृदन्त चिकीत्

चिकीर्षन्त् (he should wish to do) (wishing to do)

लङ्

d. Like the other secondary stems, the HERRI always forms its

future with इट्.

Examples: Vo (do facilla

facilidah (he will wish to do) (I will wish to do)

e. Like the other derivative stems, it forms only the peripitas

tic perfect. Example:

va (do) feltetnih

(he wished to do)

18.23

The most frequently encountered forms of the ER are two nominal forms that are peculiar to it. These are:

1. an adjective ending in -3 that indicates that the person or

thing modified by it is desirous of doing the action or un dergoing the state expressed by the simple root.

328

2. a Elif noun in - 371 that indicates the actual desire to do

or undergo what is expressed by the simple root. Both forms are derived by substituting the proper ending 3 or 311 for the final 37 of the HER stem. Examples: Root Stem Adjective Meaning Vēs (do) pareste foarte (wishing to do) vqe (fight) fra gyce (wishing to fight) VETI (know) fosila sisig (wishing to know,

curious) धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे समवेता युयुत्सवः । मामकाः पाण्डवाश्चैव किमकुर्वत सञ्जय ॥

श्रीमद्भगवद्गीता १.१ (What did my sons and the sons of Pāņdu do, gathered on the Kuru field, the field of dharma, eager for batile, O Sanjaya.) (MEMORIZE THIS VERSE) (See 20.11.j.) Examples: Root Stem Nominal form Meaning VTT (think) fisica e (the desire to know

curiosity) ) fact faster

(the desire to do)

b. A number of these nouns of type 2. take somewhat re

stricted meanings. Emples:

Root

Noun Meaning Vमन् (think) HITHI (inquiry, name of a

philosophical school of vedic

speculation) V319 (get) $441 (desire (esp. to get]) VEL (hear) TN (obedience) Valy (drive off) TCHI (loathing, repulsion) 1पा (drink) पिपासा (thirst)

भुज् (eat) बुभुक्षा (hunger)329

18.24

A folyett may be based on the ER stem. The form is generated by substituting the wife marker for the final 31 of the desiderative stem and using, of course, the 31164-146 end ings. Examples: V (do) I factoza I (It is desired to be done by me

[i.e., I want to do it).)

18.25

18.26

Vआप् (obtain) शुभमीप्स्यते सर्वैः । (Everyone wants the good.) HER of TUIER It is possible to form a secondary verbal derivative based on another such derivative. An example would be tarta, the प्रथम एक परस्मैपद

लट् of the सनन्त derivative of the णिजन्त derivative of the root V4(be). This would mean "he wishes to cause to be." Such tertiary forms are not at all common and need not be studied here. 152, 45 : The Intensive The last of the secondary verbal derivatives has two forms, the 452 and the Town. Called in English the intensive, or the frequentative, it indicates that the action or state signified by the verbal root is either repeated or of great force or intensity. Its characteristic is a reduplication marked by particularly strong forms of the 372d syllable. It may (45-) or may not (यङ्लुगन्त) have the stem sign य, called यङ् by the grammar ians. The intensive can be made from nearly every root in the language except roots of more than one syllable, roots that begin with a vowel, and roots belonging to the tenth M. Examples:

चेक्रियते

(he does repeatedly) देदीयते

(he gives generously)

a. Stem Formation

Both the यङन्त and the यलुगन्त require अभ्यास (reduplica tion) to form their stems. The rules for 37214 are generally

330

the same as those found for the third Tu roots (7.22) and for the fourt (perfect) (17.6). However, in the Sathe 4 is added to the root prior to reduplication and the root is sub jected to the same changes that are found with the passive (9.25) stem formation. In the 458 the reduplication is based on the root alone. In the intensive the reduplicated syllable is unusually strong. The strengthening of the re duplicated syllable is accomplished in one of three ways. i. Like the third am roots and the me, the first conso

nant of a root is reduplicated. But unlike these, the root vowel in the reduplicated syllable is strong: 37 and * reduplicate as 311, 5 and $ reduplicate as , and 3 and 39 reduplicate as 37. Examples:

Root Stem यङ्लुगन्त

विद् वावद् राहु जोहु

यङन्त

Vदा भू

देदीय बोभूय

ii. The entire root is reduplicated. This type usually in

volves roots that end in or or a nasal and that have 37 or as their root vowels. Note that the final nasal of the reduplicated syllable assimilates to the follow ing consonant and the root vowel Fis strengthened to either अर् or इर्. Examples:

Root Stem यङ्लुगन्त

चर् चर्चर् हिन् जङ्घन्

331

निम् कु

ननम् चर्कर् or चर्किर्

यडन्त

जिन्

जञ्जन्य or जाजाय (following i.)

iii. This type of reduplication is seen in about thirty roots,

most having final or penultimate 1 or in roots with final or medial F. Here the entire root is reduplicated, as in ii. above, but between the reduplicated syllable and the root and $ is inserted. Note here that the gen eral rules of reduplication are for the most part ignored. Example:

Root Stem यङ्लुगन्त

/गम् गनीगम्

यङन्त

Vवृत्

वरीवृत्य

b. The यङ्लुगन्त

This form of the intensive is similar to third Tu roots of the present system (7.21 ff.), although it is conjugated only in the RHY. While in theory any verbal form in the lan guage can be made from the 45-gull, its occurrences are most commonly found in the present system. When con jugated in the present system, the reduplicated stem of the intensive will take strengthening where necessary (7.9). In strong forms, between the stem and consonant initial terminations, ang may optionally be inserted (except when the reduplication follows type iii. above). Before this $, root final vowel will take T, but a root medial vowel re mains unchanged. Note that, like the conjugation of the 3rd गण, the प्रथम° बहु° लट् ending is -अति and the प्रथम° बहु°

5° will take 3:.

332

Examples: Vविद् वेविद् weak stem (to really know)

वेवेद् strong stem एक०

द्वि० बह वेवेत्ति / वेविदीति वेवित्तः वेविदति वेवेत्सि / वेविदीषि वेवित्थः वेवित्थ वेवेहि / वेविदीमि वेविद्वः वेविह्यः

अवेवेत् or अवेविदीत् लोट् वेवेत्तु or वेविदीतु विधि लिङ् वेविद्यात् वर्तमाने कृदन्त वेविदन्त

बोभू weak stem बोभो strong stem

प्रथम एक प्रथम द्वि प्रथम बहु° लट् बोभोति /बोभवीति बोभूतः बोभुवति

लङ्

The यङन्त The is the more common form of the intensive in the later language. To its reduplicated stem, the 31164-14G end ings are added. From this form of the intensive all verbal forms of the language can be made. Examples: Root

Stem Vदा देदीय प्रथम एक

लट्

देदीयते लङ्

अदेदीयत

लोट

देदीयताम्

विधि लिङ् periphrastic perfect

देदीयत देदीयां चक्रे देदीयिष्यते देदीप्यते

लट्

कर्मणि लट

18.27 TU : The Denominative

Another source of verbal forms in Sanskrit is the 71441, or noun-root, which, as its name implies, is a technique for deriv ing verbal forms from nouns. This technique is common in English. Consider such sentences as: "Stop clowning!";“We're just kidding around"; "I wish he would stop badgering me"; and so forth. No doubt you can think of many others. In each of these sentences a verb is generated from a noun as opposed to a “verbal” infinitive (in English). In the examples, the sub ject of the action is either behaving like the signified noun in

question or treating the object like that thing. 18.28 Forms such as these, not directly derived from a 7 (verbal

root) but from a 14. (noun), are common in classical San skrit. The basic meaning of these forms may be summarized as follows, in decreasing order of importance, letting X stand for any nominal item (noun or adjective): 1. a. become X (especially if X is an adjective);

b. act like, imitate X (especially if a noun) 2. a. turn into X;

b. regard or treat as X 3. desire X 4. do or perform X (especially if X is a noun expressing an

action)

Meanings 1 and 2 are by far the most important. 18.29 Formation of 214 Stems

The characteristic sign of the नामधातु is य, which is suffixed to nominal stems. Therefore, like the णिजन्त and सनन्त, नामधातु-s are treated just like the present stems of 37 71 roots. a. As one would expect, nominal stems with final 37 form

the bulk of 7 stems. Here 37 is added to the stem whose final 31 is either unchanged or lengthened. i. In practice, examples with lengthening are more

common, tend to take the 31764-146 endings, and are generally used in meaning 1.

334

Examples: Noun

नामधातु लट् Chl: (m) (crow) Alcohled jac (adj) (white) 74714

FHE: (m) (lion)

fHERA

Meaning (He acts like a crow.) (It becomes (turns] white.) (He plays the lion (i.e., is brave, etc.)) (He becomes (or acts) young.)

Jou (adj) (young) dhura

ii. Where the final 37 is unchanged, the forms tend to

take the 4G endings and are generally used in meaning 2. Examples: Noun

नामधातु लट् Meaning तरुण (adj) (young) तरुणयति । (He makes

[someone) young.) 1463 (adj) (white) Jocura (He makes (paints)

(something] white.) F#: (m) (lion) fügefa (He treats or regards

[something) as a

lion.) This distinction is a general one and not absolute. How ever, it is a fair generalization that stems with 31 and the 31144946 endings are 3744 and are used reflexively while stems with अ and the परस्मैपद endings are सकर्मक. Examples: सुवचनेन शत्रुमित्रायते । (Through kind words an enemy becomes a friend.)

सुवचनेन स शत्रु मित्रयति । (Through kind words he makes his enemy a friend.)

335

b. Nouns with other stem finals are relatively less common.

They are treated as follows: i. 34 usually remains unchanged.

Example:

(f) (girl) Daire (becomes a girl)

ii. 3, $ or 3, 5 become $or 3.

Example:

FRI (f) (woman) te (becomes a woman)

iii. Consonant endings usually remain unchanged.

Example: 74: (n) (homage) Hela (do homage)

iv. But final consonants may be lost, especially when the

middle endings are used in meaning 1. Here, the pre ceding vowel is treated as the final. Examples:

T56 (m) (king) Taila (he plays the king,

acts like the king) 31HE (f) (nymph) अप्सरायते (seems to be an

apsaras)

18.30

Use of the 714416 A common and characteristic application of the 14 injects irony into meaning 1. to indicate the fact that a person or thing is either incapable of acting like another, is foolishly acting like another, or in some way (ironically) appears to be another. Learn these two examples:

1. WHGRROR S9 Al TERCI (Even though perched on the pinnacle of a palace, a crow does not become an eagle. (i.e., No matter how high a fool may rise, he remains a fool.))

336

2. Hanah asetat Hancuri (When she attains sixteen years of age, even a sow becomes a nymph. [i.e., Any girl seems beautiful in the first blush of youth.))

EXERCISES

Translate the reading up to the sentence beginning with 2146 and identify by simple root and form all forms from secondary roots. Do the same for the reading from T440 to 3R al. Do the same for the remainder of the reading. Then translate into Sanskrit the sentences that follow using the fusta and HER wherever possible. Avoid, however, forming the HERI of fursa-s. Translate the following into Sanskrit (for vocabulary, see English-Sanskrit glossary below).

1. Having caused Rāma dwell in the forest, Kaikeyi will wish

to make Bharata king. 2. Thinking, “The prince wants to kill me," Lakşmaņa was

desirous of fighting. 3. Bharata, the knower of dharma, had his army bathe in the

Ganges. (Use periphrastic perfect.) 4. Lakşmaņa wanted to fight Bharata but was unable to an

ger Rāma. 5. A donkey does not become a lion by a roar; a man does

not become a hero by boasting. 6. The boy places the fruit at his teacher's feet. 7. The two boys should inform their mother and father of all

that happened. 8. Let the old sage teach(foT5ial of VD us the Rgveda. 9. Angering his father, the young child wanted to see his

mother. 10. His curiosity made him follow Rāma to the forest.

337

E.

Translate and memorize the following two verses (see vocabu lary for verses, below). 1. The first verse, from the Rāmāyaṇa, is a charming descrip

tion of the monkey Hanumān's delight upon thinking that he has found the kidnapped Sītā. It is especially valuable to memorize as it provides a fine drill for the perfect (लिट्), periphrastic perfect, imperfect (5), and causative (FOTSTRI).

आस्फोटयामास चुचुम्ब पुच्छं ननन्द चिक्रीड जगौ जगाम । स्तम्भानरोहविपपात भूमौ निदर्शयन्स्वां प्रकृति कपीनाम् ॥

2. The second verse, from भर्तृहरि-s"वैराग्यशतक" (hundred verses

concering withdrawal from the worldly life), illustrates two things, the aging poet's battle with craving and the नामधातुः.

19.0

19.1

Additional Pronouns In addition to the pronominal stem तत् (सः, तत् , सा) (5.5ff.), Sanskrit has two important pronominal paradigms which you

must leam. Both are like तत् etc., in that they are demonstra tive, construe with verbs in the प्रथमपुरुष, and may serve in the senses of "the," "this," and "that." The stems are: 1) अयम् (m), इदम् (n), इयम् (f), and 2) असौ (m), अदः (n), असौ (f). Of the two, the first is the more common. The second, 3tal, when it is used, usually conveys a sense of remoteness, as in "that" (as opposed to "this"). 3714 may indicate something less remote or be used generally. The paradigms are as fol lows: a. i. अयम् (पुंलिङ्ग); इदम् (नपुंसकलिङ्ग)

अमूषाम् अमुष्याम् अमुयोः Notice that the pronominal endings are virtually the same

as those already learmed.

अमुवा

अमूषु

These pronouns, especially the first, are immensely useful and are used as commonly as सः, तत्, and सा. Examples: कस्येदं गृहम् । (Whose house is this?)

अस्मिन्कलौ युगे धर्मः शिथिलायते । (Dharma grows lax in this Kali age.)

345

किमनेन ।

(What of that?)

इयमतीव सुन्दरी (This one (i.e., she) is very beautiful.)

a. The first of these pronouns is sometimes used, especially

in "politeness formulas," with a noun meaning "person, man, woman," and so forth, as a very formal equivalent to the उत्तम पुरुष pronoun. प्रथम पुरुष verbs are of course still

required. Example:

क्षम्यतामयं जनः । (Excuse me [lit., Let this person be excused).)

Houll-s : Numerals Certain of the numerals and some techniques for numbering have already been introduced, including the number one in its function as an indefinite article (see 5.7)—, the collec tive nouns -&44 (a pair), -7744 (trio), and so forth, fal compounds, and the ordinal numbers applied to the grammati cal categories of case and person. However, a more systematic treatment of the issue of numbering will be useful. The carri numerals are, in fact, the source of our so-called "Arabic” numeral. Both systems work in the same way. Thus, one need leam only nine figures and the sign zero in order to write out the figures for any number. The more important num bers, with their symbols, names, and arabic equivalents are:

The words for the numbers intervening between decades, e.g., २१, ३३,६४, etc., are generally formed by prefixing a form of the "unit number" to the “decade number." Examples: एकविंशतिः

(twenty-one) त्रयस्त्रिंशत् (thirty-three)

(sixty-four) However, for the number immediately preceding each mul tiple of १० (e.g., १९, २९, ३९), it is also common to construct a compound consisting of the next highest decade preceded by the adjective ऊन ("less, deficient"), which in tum may or may

not be preceded by the word एक. नवदश (nineteen) ऊनविंशतिः (twenty deficient by one)= १९ (nineteen) एकोनविंशतिः (twenty deficient by one)

रातिः

S

Cardinal Numbers a. The words for the numbers from one to nineteen are treated

as adjectives. They must, insofar as their individual stems permit, agree with the noun indicating the thing numbered in case, number, and gender.

347

(yarroy

Examples: कामदेवस्य पञ्चभिः पुष्पितशरैर्हतो ऽस्मि । (I am smitten by the five flowery arrows of Kāmadeva.) रामस्य तुल्यो नास्ति त्रिषु लोकेषु । (Rāma has no equal in the three worlds.)

तिसृणां दशरथभार्याणां चत्वारः पुत्रा बभूवः ।

(Dasaratha's three wives had four sons.)

b.

The words for the numbers from 20 to infinity are gener ally treated as nouns. They each have their own gender and construe with the thing numbered in one of two ways. i. The item numbered is in the 481 fat and is gram

matically subordinated to the word indicating number. Examples: शतं पुरुषाणामागच्छति । (A hundred men come.)

देवानां सहस्रेष्वपि शोभन्ते राघवाः । (The Rāghavas shine even among thousands of gods.)

The word for the number is in case apposition with the thing numbered. For example: शतं देवाः (a hundred gods)

19.6

The declension of the adjectival numbers (i.e., 9-98) requires some special attention. a. 06: This word belongs to the pronominal declension (like

Hd, etc.). It is also used as an indefinite article and in this usage may occur in the 48999 in the sense of "some," "certain," Examples: एकस्मिन्दिने राजा वनं ययौ । (One day the king went to the forest.)

348

एके वदन्ति यत् ... (Some people say that ...) एक has no द्विवचन.

b. द्वि.except in समास, is treated as though its stem were द्व. It

is therefore declined like any -37 stem adjective in all three genders, but only, of course, in the द्विवचन. Examples:

द्वौ पुरुषो जग्मतुः । (Two men went.)

द्वे कन्ये वदतः । (Two girls speak.)

अनयोर्द्वयोः पुस्तकयोः किं मया पठनीयम् । (Which of these two books am I to read?)

c. Numbers ३ through १९ have only बहुवचन forms. त्रि be

haves like a regular s stem in the पुंलिङ्ग and नपुंसकलिङ्ग in all forms except the net where 74110714 would appear to be formed from a stem त्रय. Examples: इमानि त्रीणि पुस्तकानि मया पठितानि । (I read these three books.)

बीनाक्षसाञ्जघान । (He killed three rākşasas.)

त्रिभ्यः पुरुषेभ्य इमे त्रयो गजा देयाः ।

(These three elephants are to be given to the three men.)

The Filis, however, is formed from the stem fars, which is declined more or less like any - stem, except that its प्रथमा and द्वितीया show no strength and are the same (i.e:, तिस्रः), and its षष्टी has a short rather than long stem vowel (i.e., तिसृणाम्).349

Example: तिसृभिर्नारीभिः सेव्यमानागच्छति सीता ।

(Sītā comes attended by three women.)

d. चतुर् : Here again, as with -त्रि, the पुंलिङ्ग and नपुंसकलिङ्ग form

from a different stem than that of the स्त्रीलिङ्ग. Unlike -त्रि, however, the पुंलिङ्ग and नपुंसकलिङ्ग forms have a strong and a weak stem. The strong stem is Elcar while the weak stem is चतुर् :

पुंलिङ्ग नपुंसकलिङ्ग प्र० चत्वारः चत्वारि । द्वि० चतुरः चत्वारि ,

चतुर्भिः चतुर्व्यः चतुर्णाम्

चतुर्यु

Example: यस्य चत्वारि मुखानि सन्ति तेनैव चत्वारो वेदा अवगम्यन्ते । (The four vedas are understood only by him who has four faces [i.e., Brahmā].)

The स्त्रीलिङ्ग stem is चतसृ, anditis declined exactly like तिसृ (see 19.6.c above).

e.

The numbers through 98 do not distinguish gender. Except for षष्, they are declined somewhat like नपुंसकलिङ्ग stems in -371, with the following exceptions: i. The प्रथमा and द्वितीया appear to have the forms of the

singular of such stems. Examples: पञ्च पुरुषाः (five men) सप्त देव्यः (seven goddesses) नव रत्नानि (nine gems)

350

ii. The 481 is like that of a stem with a final 37.

Example: दशानां गुरूणां शिष्यः ...

(The pupil of ten teachers ...) iii. षष् has the following declension:

प्र, द्वि

षट्

षभिः च०प०

षड्भ्यः षण्णाम्

षट्तु

19.8

Ordinal Numbers Ordinal numbers, indicating numerical position in a sequence (e.g., first, second, third, etc.), correspond to the cardinal num bers. They are all adjectival in nature. The ordinals are: a. प्रथम or आद्य

(first) द्वितीय

(second) तृतीय

(third) चतुर्थ, तुरीय, or तुर्य (fourth) पञ्च म

(fifth) ਬਈ

(sixth) सप्तम

(seventh) अष्टम

(eighth) नवम

(ninth) दशम

(tenth)

b. For the numbers from 99 through 98, the ordinals are the

same as the cardinals. For the numbers over 20, the ordinal may be of two forms: i. the suffix -414 is added to the cardinal,

Examples: विंशतितम

(twentieth) त्रयस्त्रिंशत्तम (thirty-third) शततम

(hundreth)

351

ii. reduction of the cardinal back to its final -31, and if its

final vowel is -, substitution of - 31 for -ş. Examples:

(twentieth) अशीत

(eightieth) षष्ट

(sixtieth) (do not confuse with 8

sixth)

विंश

19.9

illess

All ordinals, therefore, are -37 stems. a. 424, 31E, facrita, data, rata, and he have their

forms in 371. b. All other nouns have their fins form in $.

Examples: प्रथमा विभक्ति (nominative case) द्वितीया विभक्ति (accusative case)

सप्तमी विभक्ति (locative case)

: The Aorist Sanskrit has yet another full-fledged and elaborate verbal con jugation with which the beginning student must somehow come to grips. This is the g5 , or so-called "aorist." The gs has been left for last for a reason. It occurs in the classical lan guage with much less frequency than either the 5 or fore, the other preterite tenses. In fact, its use in the classical language is restricted largely to pieces and passages in which the author wishes to show his command of obscure forms. On the other hand, certain aorist forms of particular roots are not uncom mon, and these must be learned. Moreover, there is a particular usage of aorist forms (19.18) that occurs with some frequency

and with which one should be familiar. 19.11 As its name implies, the 3Eldar Ta 5 is yet another past tense.

The term 3TEA, "of today," is meant to complement the terms 31AETA (2953), “not of today," and Pia (Re), “remote," thus

352

19.12

19.13

distinguishing three basic kinds of past. However, as in the case of the other past tenses, no such distinction can be ob served in usage. In short, the 5, 5 and foc are quite freely interchangeable as simple past tenses. Types of The “aorist," in fact, comprehends three basic types, several of which have subtypes of their own. It is not intended that you attempt to memorize the rules for the gs formation in the way that forms like the 5 must be learned. Therefore, the follow ing represents a brief synopsis of the major features and usages of the aorist system. Particular usages which should be leamed are stressed. The three basic types, according to the stem for mation, are:

1. the simple aorist 2. the sibilant aorist 3. the reduplicated aorist The Simple Aorist: The Root Aorist The simple aorist has two subtypes: the root-aorist and the 37 aorist. a. The root-aorist is restricted to a small number of roots with

final 31 and the root v4. It is formed as follows. i. The stem consists of the preterite augment 37 prefixed

directly to the unchanged root. ii. To this stem are then added the appropriate secondary

H146 endings, except in the case of 94194, CECH, where the ending -3: is used. ii. The treatment of the common root v4 differs from

that of the roots with final 311 in that: a. The प्रथमपुरुष, बहुवचन takes the regular secondary

ending -अन्. b. Before the endings beginning with a vowel (i.e.,

ge1944,699 and 3714954, oboleh) the letter is inserted after the 3 of the stem.

re:

a

"

353 b. The paradigms, then, of val and V4, are:

बहु अदात् / अभूत् अदाताम् / अभूताम् अदुः / अभूवन् अदाः / अभूः अदातम् / अभूतम् अदात / अभूत अदाम् / अभूवम् अदाव / अभूव अदाम / अभूम

The Simple Aorist: The 31 Aorist The 31 aorist may be made from a fairly large number of roots, but is not usually formed in the आत्मनेपद. It is formed simply by suffixing short 37 to the root, prefixing the augment, and adding the appropriate secondary endings. Only roots with final a take गुण. In short, except for a roots, the form is made exactly like the 5 of the sixth T. It is not, of course, re stricted to roots of any 14. Examples that you may see are

गम् and Vवच्. Note particularly that Vवच् in this form takes the irregular stem form ata. Example: इदं वचनमवोचत् । (He spoke this speech.)

Sibilant Aorists This class of four subtypes is so named because the tense-sign of each either consists of or contains the consonant For The tense signs are (1) स् or ष्, (2) इष्, less commonly (3) सिष् and (4)स. All forms require the preterite augment prefixed to the roots and take, with some slight variation, the secondary end

354

ings. Unlike the root aorist and in general the 31 aorist, the sibilant forms have both परस्मैपद and आत्मनेपद conjugations. The आत्मनेपद forms serve also as the आत्मनेपद conjugation for roots of the root aorist. a. The स् Aorist

This form is relatively common for an aorist. i. Its stem is formed by prefixing the augment to the root,

which usually is strengthened. His added to this strengthened root. The rules for root strength are: a. Final vowels.

Final vowels are subject to वृद्धि in परस्मैपद and गुण in 31642146. But final #s takes no strength in the आत्मनेपद.

परस्मैपद आत्मनेपद Root

Stem

Stem Vश्रु (hear) अश्रौष

अश्रोष् कृ (do)

अकृष्

अकार्ष

b. Medial vowels.

Medial vowels are, ‘वृद्धि-ed' (if in a लघु syllable) in परस्मैपद and unchanged in आत्मनेपद. Root

परस्मैपद आत्मनेप रुध् (block) अरौत्स् अरुत्स् Vदृश (see) अद्राक्ष(cf. 13.1.b)अदृक्ष

ii. Endings: To the stem are added the normal secondary

endings with three notable exceptions: a. प्र° बहु° परस्मैपद takes -3: (not -अन्) b. प्र° बहु° आत्मनेपद takes -अत (not -अन्त),

____and, most important,

प्रथम and मध्यम एक परस्मैपद have the vowel ई inserted between the stem and the endings. This is important as it lends a distinctive shape to these forms, which are in any case the only ones you are at all likely to see.

355

For example:

कु (do) अकार्षीत् । अकार्षीः (he/you did) Vदृश् (see) अद्राक्षीत् / अद्राक्षीः (he/you saw) Vनी (lead) अनैषीत् । अनैषीः (he/you led) Vश्रु (hear) अश्रौषीत् । अश्रौषीः (he/you heard)

बहु

अद्राक्षुः

b.

The complete paradigm of vel (see) is

एक प्र. अद्राक्षीत्

अद्राष्टाम् म. अद्राक्षीः अद्राष्टम्

अद्राष्ट उ० अद्राक्षम्

अद्राक्ष्व

अद्राक्ष्म Memorize only the examples given in (c.) above. The 54 Aorist This form, less commonly encountered than the above, is of a similar formation. i. It takes the augment and adds 54 to the root, which is

strengthened as follows: a. Final vowels are strengthened as with the स् aorist,

but here is no exception, Example: Root

परस्मैपद आत्मनेपद Vपू (cleanse) अपाविष् अपविष्

b. Medial vowels have गुण in परस्मैपद and आत्मनेपद if

in a my syllable,

Examples: Root

परस्मैपद आत्मनेपद रुच् (shine) अरोचिष अरोचिष but Visita (live) अजीविष अजीविष्

___Medial -अ- is occasionally lengthened in परस्मैपद. ii. Endings: Endings are as for the al aorist. Here, too,

the endings of the प्रथम, मध्यम, एकवचन परस्मैपद are, ईत, ई.. Moreover, before these two endings, the sibi lant tense marker is dropped.

356

For example:

Root Vबुध् (be awakened) अबोधीत् / अबोधीः (he [was] /

you (were) awakened) Do not bother to memorize this form. C. The fH Aorist

This form, rarer still than the preceding one, is made only from roots in - 341 and three roots in-374 ; 174 1P (bow); V24 1P (Heula) (reach); V4 1Ā (take pleasure). It occurs only in the परस्मैपद, its आत्मनेपद being formed like the स् aorist. It is formed exactly like the 54 aorist. Example:

प्रथम / मध्यम एक स्था (stand) अस्थासीत् / अस्थासीः (he / you stood) Do not bother to memorize this form.

d. The 8 Aorist

This form can be made only from 23 roots, few of which are very common. These roots share the following char acteristics: i. They all end in 2.7, or sounds, which join with the

H of the tense sign to form the conjunct . ii. Their root vowels are 5, 3, or 7.

a. His added to the augmented and unstrengthened

root. b. To this are added the appropriate secondary end

ings with a few exceptions which are prescribed by the grammarians but which, owing to the rarity of the form, cannot be cited from the literature. A typical paradigm is that of VII 6P (point out):

357

19.16

परस्मैपद

आत्मनेपद एक द्वि० बहु एक द्वि० बहु प्र° अदिक्षत् अदिक्षताम् अदिक्षन् । अदिक्षत अदिक्षाताम् अदिक्षन्त म° अदिक्षः अदिक्षतम् अदिक्षत | अदिक्षथाः अदिक्षाथाम् अदिक्षध्वम् उ० अदिक्षम् अदिक्षाव अदिक्षाम | अदिक्षि अदिक्षावहि अदिक्षामहि

Do not bother to memorize this form. The Reduplicated Aorist This form, also not common, is of some interest because it is the form that corresponds in meaning (although there is no formal affinity) to the forstol, or causative, conjugations. It is characterized by a peculiar and quite distinctive 3p24 or re duplication. The 31 21H syllable is formed according to the general rules, with 37 and # vowels becoming 3. What is distinctive about the form is that it always favors a contrast of लघुत्व (metrical lightness) and गुरुत्व (metrical heaviness) be tween the 312H and root syllables. Thus, if the root syllable is लघु, the अभ्यास vowel will be lengthened to make it गुरु. Examples: Root

Stem Vशम् (be quiet)

अशीशम् (make quiet, calm) जन् (be born)

अजीजन् (give birth to)

If the root syllable is Ts (i.e., long vowel or short before con junct), the 374 syllable will be light and, in this case only, an अ vowel will appear as अ in the अभ्यास. This is quiterare. The stem thus formed is given a final 31, as though it were the imperfect stem of an 37 root, and receives the endings proper to such a root. The paradigm of var is as follows:

परस्मैपद

आत्मनेपद एक द्वि० बह | एक द्वि० बह प्र. अशीशमत् अशीशमताम् अशीशमन् अशीशमत अशीशमेताम् अशीशमन्त म. अशीशमः अशीशमतम् अशीशमत | अशीशमथाः अशीशमेथाम् अशीशमध्वम् उ० अशीशमम् अशीशमाव अशीशमाम | अशीशमे अशीशमावहि अशीशमामहि

358

The form is not common enough to worry about, but its com mon metrical structure of

represented by the sequence: augment, heavy 37 H, light root, any 050 427446 ending, makes it easy enough to recognize. Examples: कौसल्या राममजीजनत् ।। (Kausalyā gave birth to Rāma.) तदा वीराः कोपाग्निमशीशमन् । (Then the heroes extinguished the fire of (their) anger.)

19.17 gery, adeh, Hifl, 55

The aorist has various modes, none of which you need learn, and, as with any non-present form, its 31764-146 forms may be used in difer. However, there is a special, peculiar, ditur प्रयोग form, which occurs only in the प्रथम एक° and has no regular conjugation. It is formed by adding the personal ending 5 to the augmented and generally strengthened root. a. The root is strengthened as follows:

i. Final vowels and usually medial -34- in a light syllable

are subject to वृद्धि. ii. Other medial vowels, if in light syllables, are subject

to M. iii. After final 371, the consonant is placed before the

ending (5) Examples: Root Vदा (give) अदायि (it was given) कृ (do) अकारि (it was done)

19.18

The Injunctive There is one usage made of the g5 forms which is quite dif ferent from the basic preterite application. This is the so-called injunctive, or negative imperative, which may be formed from any 5 form by dropping the augment and using the regular359

prohibitive particle (41) (see 11.18). In classical Sanskrit, this usage is perhaps more common than the preterite one. For example: Root

In junctive कृ (do) तन्मा कार्षीः ।

(Don't do that!) भू (be) भरतो राजा मा भूत् । (Let Bharata not be

king!) गम् (go) हे अर्जुन । क्लैब्यं मा गमः । (O Arjuna! Do not be

a weakling! [lit., Do not go to unmanliness!))

## 20 कृत् and तद्धित-प्रत्ययाः, च्वि, Nominal Derivation and Sanskrit Vocabulary

20.0

20.1

The grammatical complexity of Sanskrit is such that, in the first year, it tends to overshadow other areas of language learning, especially the acquisition of a working vocabulary. Nonetheless, the major features of the grammar will soon, through constant repetition, become quite familiar. Vocabulary, on the other hand, tends to loom as a greater issue when one begins reading Sanskrit texts. With Sanskrit, more perhaps than other languages, the beginning student feels that he or she never seems to be able to learn enough words so that he or she can obtain some modicum of freedom from the dictionary.

There are a number of reasons for the extraordinary richness of the Sanskrit lexicon. One of the reasons concerns the deri vation of nouns and adjectives from verbal roots. Despite the relatively small number of verbal roots in common use, it is possible, through the use of the 344-1-s and a wide variety of derivational suffixes, to make a given root the base for a large number of words. By combinations and permutations of the 34621-s and suffixes, it would easily be possible to generate a hundred words from a single root. Mastery of the more impor tant of these suffixes, like a knowledge of the 34679-s, is, therefore, of immense help in the task of acquiring a working Sanskrit vocabulary. Sanskrit derivational suffixes are called Yeri-s and fall into two major categories depending upon whether they are added directly to a UTC or to some more complex form. Suffixes that are added directly to a verbal root are called a pris (pri mary suffixes), while those added to a formalready derived by कृत् or other derivation are called तद्धित प्रत्यय-s (secondary suf

20.2

the f

fixes). For example, from the root v4 (awaken), we may derive, by means of a familiar कृत् प्रत्यय -त,' the form बुद्ध (भूते PGRI) (awakened, enlightened, the Buddha). Then, from this F derivative, we may further derive, by means of a alga pera,

(a follower of the enlightened one, a Buddhist). The most important ca-s and their basic functions are best leamed according to their basic category (i.e., कुत् or तद्धित), and within each category, according to their significance. Be fore going on to examine the yepy-s, however, it is essential that you be thoroughly familiar with the grades of vowel strength called ju and al(3.5-7). These vowel grades are often characteristic of the various kinds of nominal derivation, and it is difficult to relate many forms to their underlying forms without a clear, virtually automatic, knowledge of the grades of the simple vowels. If you cannot immediately see that the words GRR11, 2729, 2A, SIG, 3174, and I are derived from GRAI, TY, FACT, TG, # and V5 respectively, go back to 3.5-7 and learn the vowel grades thoroughly. Major op Hep-s

derivation is primary in that it depends on the simple ver bal U19-s of the language. Although all three vowel grades (no strength, Tu and alg) occur in various examples of orderi vation, it is a fair generalization to say that ju is the most characteristic while the other two are less common. There is one group of H R -s that should by now be quite familiar to you. These—the participial, infinitive, gerundive, and gerund suffixes such as -a, -7, -14, -404, -7, -37-112, -cai, and -234-have been discussed elsewhere. There remain, however, a number of R-s that are used to derive nouns and adjectives from the verbal roots. Such de rivatives differ somewhat from the participles in that they generally lose their verbal character insofar as they do not so clearly have opel-s and 24-s in sentences.

20.4

20.5

IS a

ΠΟ

a. faay

The simplest of these suffixes, is the zero, or feqq er. Derivative nouns with this suffix consist simply of the verbal root with or without an 3440f. Such forms are rela tively rare and are restricted to a few items, mostly Fit nouns expressing the action of the root. Examples: Root

Derivative दृश् (see)

दृश (f) (sight)

(608) Vyu (fight)

(f) (fight, battle)

( YED(see 3.25.a) 34 + A + VHG (1P) 347796 [-(f) (upanişad) (sit down near (Fical) H4 + VÆG (1P) HHT (- (f) (assembly) (sit together)

R + VHG (1P) upra (-a) (1) (assembly) (sit around) 311 + V96 (1P) 31146 (-2) (f) (calamity, (undergo misfortune)

misfortune)

The 1994 444, however, is more common in forms occurring at the end of compounds (see 12.17). Here, it forms an agent noun, i.e., a noun identifying the agent of the action of the root. Unlike action nouns, agent nouns can take any gender, depending on the inherent gender of the person or thing iden tified as agent. Examples: VETI (9P) (know)

: (knower of everything) VFG (1P) (conquer) 15 (conqueror of Indra) (see 21.1) VGT (3P) (give) a (m prop) (boon giver,

Brahmā)

370

b. 31

This is the most important derivational suffixes in the lan guage. It is added freely to a large number of roots and with them forms of a great number of action nouns mostly

10. Before this suffix, the following changes in the root

occur: 1. A root vowel, if capable of Ju (i.e., in a light syllable or a

final long vowel), takes it. (In fact, this suffix is largely

restricted to such cases.) 2. Medial 31 is subject to ale, but this is not invariably the

case. 3. Some final vowels are likewise subject to g. 4. A ou (palatal) Furt, and sometimes in root final posi

tion revert, before the 21, to their corresponding usz (velar). Examples: Root

Derivative Vis (1P) (conquer) 314: (m) (conquest, victory) VF4. (4P) (be angry) 14: (m) (anger) VpU (4P) (be angry) tu: (m) (anger) 3G + V (2P) (go up) 394: (m) (ascension,

1: (m) (enjoyment) R: (m) (boon)

fa + VHET (6P) (release) VEI (7P) (enjoy) vą (9Ā) (choose)

i. A few words of this derivation are neuter.

Example: ni (3P) (fear)

14 (n) (fear) ii. A few are agent nouns.

Examples: V (8P) (do) (at end of compounds) (doer,

maker, agent) HIER: (m) (light-maker, sun) कुम्भकारः (m) (pot-maker, potter). Vमिह (1P) (emit fluid, urinate) Àa: (m) (cloud)

-371 A number of roots, especially those whose vowels do not qualify for Ju or IG (i.e., short in heavy syllable or long non-final, see 7.16), form Fill action nouns with the suffix आ. Examples: Root

Derivative VHq (1A) (serve) Hal (1) (service) VAN (1Ā) (speak) 491 (f) (speech, language) Vents (1P/Ā) (play) SI (1) (play, sport) VER(10P) (think)

Famill (1) (thought, anxiety)

As seen in Lesson 18, this suffix routinely forms action nouns from the ER desiderative) stem.

372

Examples: Root 1944 (4A) (think) Vary (1Ā) (ward off)

Derivative Hial (f) (inquiry)

Chi (f) (disgust)

VO

d. -377

The suffix -37, like -37, is one of the most productive and important of the non-participial o 24p4-s. Like -37, it forms action nouns freely from many roots. Before it, root vowels generally take fun if they can. In contrast with the -31 Yep, -37 forms nouns mostly in the h o . Final

1504 (palatal) consonants are unchanged before -37A. Action nouns of this group sometimes take on a sense of object nouns, i.e., nouns indicating the object of an action, or, in the case of 3744 roots, nouns indicating the locus of action. A few are agentive. Examples: Root

Derivative VITA (1P) (go) 1474 (n) (going)

(2P) (kill) 6774 (n) (killing) Vवच

(2P) (speak) 444 (n) (speech) (3P) (give) 1974 (n) (giving, gift)

(3P) (drink) 41414 (n) (drinking, drink) VE (7P) (enjoy, eat) HSA4 (n)(enjoyment, food) vac (1P) (speak) 26574 (n) (face (mouth]) fa + VAT (1P) (adom) f ur (n) (ornament,

-37:

This suffix forms a fairly restricted group of predominantly 747105 action nouns. Before it, root vowels take ju if possible (see 9.0-9.4). Examples: Root

Derivative Vतप् (1P) (burn, 24: (n) (austerity)

perform austerity) vaz (2P) (speak) : (n) (speech)

मन् (4A) (think)

(n) (mind, thought) 1774 (1P/A) (bow, 74: (n) (homage, bow)

do homage)

47:

.f.

This suffix forms many important Eiros action nouns. Before it, roots are generally unchanged or weakened, ex actly as before the -त of the भूते कृदन्त. Examples: Root

Derivative V14 (1P) (go) fa: (f) (gait, path, way,

going (see 6.1.b)) 9 + V3114 (5P) (attain)

(f) (attainment,

3ft: He:

(f) (speech, saying) (f) (creation) (f) (pleasure, love making)

i. The common root v4G (4Ā), "go," forms 4: (f), "go

ing," despite the fact that the L GR is (see 10.12). This important root occurs only with 347-s. Examples: 37 + 196 (be born, 3c4fa: (f) (birth,

arise, originate) origin, arising) fa + V96 (experience fayfa: (f) (misfortune)

calamity) सम् + Vपद् (experience संपत्तिः (1) (good fortune)

good fortune)

g. 41

This suffix forms action nouns from a few roots. The nouns are mostly 798 5. Before the suffix, root vowels are subject to गुण. Examples: Root

Derivative 1514 (4Ā) (be born) 54 (n) (birth) VF (8P) (do, make) 49 (n) (action, karma,

grammatical object)

h. -5

This suffix forms, from a few roots, nouns that individu ally indicate an instrument or means of the action of the verbal root. These nouns are usually 7Hf55. Before this suffix root vowels are subject to ju Examples: Root

- This प्रत्यय forms agent nouns in the पुंलिङ्ग and नपुंसकलिङ्ग. Corresponding Fils nouns are formed with the suffix Fil. Before these 4424-s root vowels take ju if possible. They may be added to many roots. The suffix ? is the same one discussed in connection with stems in final # (10.0-3) and the C (16.12.2). It is added to the stem with or without the vowel 5 as noted at those places. Examples: Root

Derivative (8P) (do)

Before this suffix, certain roots in which a consonant precedes the sequence 3T are changed as follows: 34 → 317; & →&. (See 10.8.d). Example: VaE (1P) (carry) at (m, n) (carrier)

-3755 This प्रत्यय forms पुंलिङ्ग and नपुंसकलिङ्ग agent nouns. Its Fillos equivalent is usually -501, although -376h1 and 3707 are occasionally seen. It is used fairly freely. Before it, medial short vowels take 14, medial 31 and final vowels

Tic. Examples: Root

Derivative V (1P) (lead) 70: (m, n) (leader, hero)

The above are by no means all of the opp -s. They are, however, the most important and commonly used. The others do not generate enough forms to warrant your learning them. It is sufficient to learn the individual forms without worrying

377

20.8

20.9

about their derivation. You should, however, make yourself familiar with the above list of suffixes and the ways in which they work. तद्धित Derivation Just as the 224-s are used to generate a variety of nouns from the verbal roots, so the ca -s enable one to build new nominal forms based on the meanings of other nominal stems. The underlying nominal forms are called upta. The forms thus derived are of several types. Two of these, however, are most important. a. Derivative adjectives.

i. These are normally derived from nouns and indicate

that their fazlea (modificand) is in some way related to the lata. Examples: प्रकृति

Derivative 47: (n) (mind) HH (adj) (mental) sos: (m) (world) collabots (adj) (worldly) 984: (m) (man) 46.44 (adj) (human,

pertaining to men)

ii. Such adjectives are themselves often stereotyped as

nouns, especially when they refer to people who know or study the thing indicated by the प्रकृति. Examples: प्रकृति

Derivative Ollohu14 (n)

duchu (adj) (pertaining (the science of

to grammar, but grammar)

more commonly: elut: (m) (a grammarian)

iii. This kind of nominalization is regularly stereotyped

in the derivation of proper names from those of some parent or ancestor.

378

Examples: प्रकृति

Derivative GER4: (m) (Daśaratha) GERT: (m) (son of

Dasaratha, e.g.,

Rāma) grafit (f) (Kunti) 4: (m) (son of

Kunti; e.g., Arjuna)

b. Abstract nouns. This important class of nouns is derived

freely from both nouns and adjectives. If X is any noun and Y any adjective, the derivations are usually best trans lated X-hood, the state of being an X; Y-ness, the state of being Y. Examples: प्रकृति

Derivative शीत (adj) (cold) 144 (n) (cold, coolness) युवन्

(adj) (young) 1944 (n) (youth) 964: (m) (man) focal (f) (manhood)

20.10

Just as ju of a root vowel is a frequent characteristic of derivation, a characteristic mark of the aici derivation is aic. A number of the most important of the area feri-s require aic, which occurs in the initial syllable of the yefa. This rule has one relatively important exception. When the first vowel of an underlying form is immediately preceded by the semi vowel or 7, especially where the semi-vowel is the result of an external HP change of the final vowel of a quasi-indepen dent word (e.g., the 344-0-s , fa- or the coumpound forms - or -), this semi-vowel is first analyzed into 54 or 34, and the als then applies to the vowel (5 or 3). This applies to all area suffixes requiring वृद्धि. Examples: प्रकृति

Derivative 42014 (n) (grammar) 216241:(m) (grammarian)

(fa-311-2014)379

PR: (m) (logic) of: (f) (individual)

tulp: (m) (logician) Rifat (adj) (personal,

individual) Hae: (m prop) (son of

Svaśva)

Folat

(m prop) (-37:)

When a semi-vowel preceding an initial vowel is not the result of external HAU, the regular rule applies. Example: प्रकृति

Derivative Faen (m prop) (F2-4) Faria: (m) (son of

(the god Brahmā)

Brahmā)

20.11 The most important of the area fri-s are:

a. -37

This suffix is as important among als as its phonologi cal twin is among the A-s (20.6.b). It has four basic meanings, the first two of which are somewhat more im portant than the others. The meanings are: 1. 37440181 (genealogical descent) 2. Hallo (abstraction) 3. Jean

(possession) 4. JAG

(knowledge) The suffix has a Fitas counterpart, $. Both require are of the first syllable of the sofa. 37 (and $) are added to nominal stems as follows: i. They replace final 37 or 311.

Examples: प्रकृति

Derivative (m) (son) 417 (m) (grandson) 4711 (f prop) 4 : (m prop) (son of

(Yamunā river) Yamunā) uda: (m) (mountain) 9106 (f prop) (daughter of

the mountain)

380

ii. They replace final $.

Example: प्रकृति सरस्वती (f prop)

Derivative HR a: (m prop) (son of

Sarasvati)

iii. They are added to the ju of -3.

Example:

Derivative T: (m prop) 1919: (m prop) (descendant

प्रकृति

iv. They are added directly to #, which is not strength

ened. Example: प्रकृति

Derivative त्वष्ट (m prop) त्वाष्टः (m prop) (son of

Tvaşır)

V.

They are added directly to consonant stem finals. In the case of final 3TR the weak form 3 is the base. Examples: प्रकृति

This suffix is also of great importance. It is used to form a great number of nouns, mostly High (abstract), which are generally नपुंसकलिङ्ग. वृद्धि of the first syllable is general, but a number of forms show no strength.

These two Hidalgo 4224-s are extremely important. They are used with great freedom to form abstract nouns, which signify the state or condition of being that which is indi cated by the rest. They correspond to the English suffixes -ness, -hood, etc. No strength is required in the forta. Nouns formed with -त्व are नपुंसकलिङ्ग; those with -ता are स्त्रीलिङ्ग. Examples: प्रकृति

Derivative (m) (monkey) 1994 (n) (monkey-ness,

the state of being a

monkey) मधुर (adj) (sweet) Real (f) (sweetness)

This suffix functions like the one above but is generally less common. Example: प्रकृति

Derivative Hi (f) (a philosophical HHH: (m) (a follower of the

-ART This suffix, which is added directly to a nominal stem with out any vowel strength, forms adjectives conveying the

386

sense of “made of" or "consisting of the thing indicated by the प्रकृति. सन्धि before this suffix is extermal. Examples: प्रकृति

There are a number of suffixes which indicate the pos sessor (स्वामिन्) of the प्रकृति. These are said to beस्वामित्ववाचक (expressive of ownership). These have already been in troduced in the various paradigms. They are -R-OR, -59, and -104. (See 11.3 and 12.0-12.3 respectively.) Examples: प्रकृति

Derivative 981: (m) (wing) 7 (m) (bird) 49: (n) (asceticism) auto (m) (ascetic) 423: (m) (cattle) 34R (ad) (rich in cattle)

(f) (memory) Fahd (adj) (having a good

memory)

*m. 3robefalet gere

There are two unrelated sets of RR-s that are used to form comparative and superlative grades of adjectives. They are said to be 360649196 (expressive of superiority): i. -CR-comparative

-04- superlative These are added to any adjectival stem. If the stem is one that has a twofold distinction of strength, then the weaker is used; if the distinction is threefold, the middle grade is used. The object of comparison is usually in the 450 fauft.

387

Examples: Adjective प्रिय (dear)

महन्त् (great)

Comparative प्रियतर (dearer)

महत्तर (greater)

Superlative प्रियतम (dearest) 46014 (greatest)

ii. -$4:comparative

-566—superlative These are technically F RRA-s, before which a root is subject to yo. Relatively few roots take these forms in the classical language, and even then, the deriva tives are not often really related to their roots. Therefore, it is best simply to learn a few important forms. Each of the following examples shows the ad jective corresponding in meaning, not the underlying verbal root. Examples: Adjective Comparative Superlative YRIA (good) |T (better) BS (best) गुरु (heavy) गरीयः (heavier) गरिष्ठ (heaviest) युवन् (young) कनीयः (younger) कनिष्ठ (youngest) TE (old) 51: (older) 548 (oldest)

n.

iii. The declension of the superlative ending in 58 is like

that of any adjective in 31; its Flic ending is 31. On the other hand, the declension of comparatives in $4: is quite irregular. It will be given in the following

chapter. (See 21.4.) - This ri, added to any noun (stem final consonants are treated as in compounds), forms an adverb conveying the sense of “like” the referent of the world. (See 21.6.a.ii.a) Example:

Derivative (m) (monkey) 1496 (ind) (like a monkey)

प्रकृति osta

The fed repa a. This fre is treated separately from the others for two rea

sons. First, it is common and extremely versatile. Second it requires a subsidiary element, either a finite form or a derivative of the roots vp or V4. The Trupi itself is $, and it is added in place of a final vowel or directly to a final consonant. It requires no strength in the Topta. In meaning, the ita construction is rather like one use of the 149 (denominative—18.27-30), in that it indicates that a thing either becomes or is made into, literally or

figuratively, something that it is not. d. When an intransitive, reflexive sense is desired, a form of

the root v4 is used. When the transitive sense is desired, a form of the root vş is used (see 18.29.) The effect of this is to create a series of new complex “roots." Examples:

Derivative Poul (adj) (black) कृष्णीभू (1P) (to become

black) (8P) (to make black, to blacken)

प्रकृति

From these “roots" can be made any finite form and any

a derivation that can be made from the simple roots vom and V4. Note that in the formation of the gerund, the foc affix has the effect of an 3471 (see 11.7). Examples: कृष्णीभविष्यति (TOC) (it will become black) कृष्णीकरणम् (n) (blackening) कृष्णीकृत

(adj) (blackened) कृष्णीकृत्य

(gerund) (having blackened)389

e.

The fed construction has several important usages. i. If the yetà is a noun, then it indicates a genuine change

of state. For example: नृपो बालकं सैनिकीकरोति । (The king makes the boy into a soldier.) If the yeafa is an adjective, then the form indicates a change of quality:

नारी चन्दनेन स्तनद्वयं शुक्लीकरोति । (The woman whitens her breasts with sandalwood.)

ii. Perhaps an even more important usage of the fed is in

a figurative sense. Here the change of state is not real. The subject either acts like (V2), or, more often, treats or regards something like (V) the referent of the yefa. Example: अरे ते राजपुरुषास्तपोवनं नगरीकुर्वन्ति । (Hey! These policemen are turning the penance grove into a city (i.e., they are making noise and generally acting as though they were in a city).)

भो मारुते त्वया क्रमता शतयोजनविस्तीर्णसागरो गोष्पदीकृतः । (O Māruti (Hanumān]! You, in leaping, have turned the ocean, a hundred leagues across, into a puddle in) a cow's hoofprint.)

iii. Idiomatic usage: The adjective 79,"one's own," and

the indeclinable 35 (ind) (exclamation of agreement), “OK,” are used idiomatically with the fear and V to indicate acceptance, either mental or physical. Examples: इदं भोजनं स्वीकर्तव्यं भवता । (or स्वीकरोतु भवान् ।) (Please accept this food, sir.)

तादृशं वाक्यं न कदाप्यङ्गीक्रियते भारतदेशे । (Such speech is never accepted (agreed to) in India.)

390

20.13

Examples of the use of various Yeri-s. Virtually all of the Sanskrit you have learned so far has been illustrative of the principles of nominal derivation. However, a few remarks on some of the uses of this principle may be helpful. a. One valuable result of the system of suffixes is that it makes

possible a very precise and systematic evolution of techni cal terminology. Consider the root VRT (7P) with the 34H0f •fa' in the sense of “qualify, specify.” Although finite forms of the verb are not common, its nominal deri vations are very useful. Thus: i. 1914, “qualification," is used in grammar to indi

cate an adjective. farten (gerundive),"to be qualified," then means the noun modified by an adjective. The factor4, of course,

is विशिष्ट, “modified," by the विशेषणम् etc. ii. The poetic terms 3441 (f), “simile,” 3444 “subject of

comparison," and 3441 "object of comparison" are

derived from 34 + VAT (2P), “compare." iii. By use of the various suffixes one can derive many of

the important grammatical terms from the root vor. Example:

(subject) कर्मन्

(object) करणम् (instrument) क्रियापदम् (action word, verb)

कारकम्

(case relation) b. Juxtaposition of two (or more) derivations of the same root

can, by virtue of the significance of the Year, make for very powerful conciseness of speech. Example: कृतकृत्यः (बहुवीहि समास) "one who has done what he had to."

कर्त

391

C.

Here, eight English words are needed to express what can be expressed by one word in Sanskrit. Again, take the example, feu9014 (11947P-grind) "the grinding of the ground" (i.e., beating a dead horse), where five English words are needed to express one Sanskrit word.

The capacity of Sanskrit for concise utterance, through a combination of derivational techniques, nominal compo sition, and the connotative power () of the case endings, is nowhere better employed than in the 21143-s, or schol arly texts. Example:

अविद्या परिहर्तव्या जन्ममरणादिलक्षणसंसारोत्पत्तिहेतुत्वात् । (Ignorance is to be shunned because of its being the cause of the origination of the cycle of re-birth, which is charac terized by birth, death, and so forth.)

Note here how the one compound, even though it has seven members, requires twenty-three words in an English ren

dering. d. The different "meanings of the different suffixes make

for a virtually unlimited freedom of paraphrase. Take, for example, the term बुद्धवचनम् =बुद्धस्य वचनम्) "the speech of the Buddha.” By subjecting the EGR "96," which here is a noun, to further als derivation, one can generate the adjective ale, “Buddhist,” “pertaining to the Buddha.” One can then substitute the कमेधारय समास बौद्धवचनम् for the origi nal dy. Likewise, derivatives of adjectives like 48, "clear," and ta, "fast," can be used variously to convey more or less the same meanings: Examples: i. they can be used adjectivally

gia sa rai (The swift horse runs.) स्पष्टं वचनं वदति ।

(He speaks clear speech.)

392

ii. or adverbially,

378: tai yrafa स्पष्टं वदति ।

(The hose runs swiftly.) (He speaks clearly.)

iii. or, by alan derivation, they can be made into abstract

nouns which can then be put in an appropriate case, 37: TEZU yafai (The horse runs by swiftness

[i.e., swiftly).) स्पष्टतया वदति । (He speaks with clarity (i.e.,

clearly).)

e.

## 21 Additional Consonantal Stem Formations; Stems with Final संयुक्त Vowels; Some Irregular Nominal Declensions; Declension of the Comparative Suffix यांस्, यः; Some Remarks on Adverbial Formation

21.0

21.1

Aside from the nominal stems with final consonants already introduced, there is a class of nouns ending in one or another of the simple consonants. These nouns are most often mono syllabic and derive either from a root with only the 1994, or zero, suffix (20.6.a), or from a root in final short vowel to which the consonant t has been added (12.17). Nouns of this sort are normally Filles when they signify the action of a verbal root (e.g., युध् [f] [battle]; दिक् [f] [direction]) and commonly पुंलिङ्ग when they signify its agent (e.g., पापकृत् [m, f, n] [sinner]; द्विष् [m] [foe, enemy]). The declension of such stems is the same for पुंलिङ्ग and स्त्रीलिङ्ग. नपुंसकलिङ्ग stems are less common and as usual, differ in the प्रथमा and द्वितीया. The variation of the stem final consonant in the paradigms is a result of the rules of "possible word finals" (3.25). a. वाक् (स्त्रीलिङ्ग) (speech)

Irregular Declensions Aside from the regular declensions, Sanskrit, like any other language, has a number of nouns which are irregular. That is to say, these nouns fail in one or more forms, to follow the

pattern which one would expect for their stem finals and gen ders. Fortunately, the number of such nouns that are of common occurrence is rather limited. The following are the paradigms of some of the more important irregular nouns. a. सखि (पुंलिङ्ग) (friend) has a decidedly peculiar declension which should be leamed. सखी (स्त्रीलिङ्ग) is declined regularly.

(1. lord; 2. husband) is regularly declined when it means “lord, master, etc.," and in either meaning when at the end of a compound. However, when it is used to signify "husband" and is not the final member of a com pound, its declension is:

The Comparative Suffix यांस/यः This प्रत्यय, introduced in the previous chapter (20.11.m.ii), has a peculiar distinction of strength and weakness in gres and नपुंसकलिङ्ग. The strong-weak alternation is यांस् (ईयांस)/ यस् (ईयस्) (e.g., श्रेयान्/श्रेयः). The स्त्रीलिङ्ग is formed by adding ईto the weak stem and is completely regular.

अव्ययपद-s: Adverbial Formation Of the three types of words mentioned in 4.3, adverbs, or

अव्ययपद-s are naturally the cause of least difficulty. Neverthe less, a few remarks about their formation are in order.

There are many kinds of adverbs but two, especially, invite systematization. These are 1) adverbs formed by the use of special adverbial suffixes, and 2) adverbs formed by stereo typed usage of the 4 endings. a. Adverbial Suffixes

A number of the suffixes, which when added to various forms of the pronominal stems-produce the characteris tic interrogative, relative, correlative series of अव्ययपद-s (6.3), may be added to other stems. Most of them may be appended to the adjectives which decline pronominally (5.7).

407

Examples: सर्वत्र

सर्वदा

Hoa: परत्र अन्यथा अन्यत्र

(everywhere) (always) (from all sides) (elsewhere (especially "in the next word']) (otherwise) (elsewhere)

i.

The suffix -: however, may be added to virtually any nominal stem to form an adverb. Examples: Noun

Adverb 24 (n)

TEER: (ind) (according to (authoritative text) the śāstras) UF: (m) (dharma) a: (ind) (in accord with

dharma) 484 (n) (back) 981: (ind) (behind) 3741 (adj) (foremost) 3744: (ind) (first, in front,

in the beginning) H: (m) (village) 1: (ind) (from the

village)

ii. There are some other suffixes which may be used to

generate adverbs. a. ac forms an adverb from any noun X, in the sense

of “like X.” (See 20.11.9.) Examples: osta: (m) (monkey) d ata (ind) (like a monkey)

4344454: (m) (a frog in a well) 834405cpada (ind) (like a frog in a well [i.e., in

a narrow or provincial manner])

b. -Y may be added to numerals, or to adjectives

indicative of quantity, in the sense of "-fold."

408

Examples: fa "two"

fen (ind) (twofold) (adj) “many" OBUT (ind) (manifold) एकं सद्विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति ।। (Sages call by many names what is really one be ing.)

c. - 7: may also be added to numbers or quantifiers

to indicate the sense of “by so many at a time.” Examples: 2014 (n) (hundred) TERT: (by the hundred) शत्रूजधान शतशः सहस्रशश्च । (He slew his enemies by the hundreds and thou sands.)

b. सुप् Endings

A very common and often deceptive feature of Sanskrit is the fact that the 14 terminations themselves are frequently stereotyped as adverbial markers. This phenomenon is most marked with the facile and less freely, the cardi end ings, although other cases show it sporadically. 300477 forms are most common, although occasional 6999 forms occur. i. Pasien

The Parten, Cabda7, 79H5|es forms of nouns and even of pronouns, are freely used as adverbs, a. pronouns

किम्

(why) (in that, insofar as)

(in that way) b. adjectives fisi ya

(He runs swiftly.) मन्दं मन्दं नुदति पवनो मेघम् । (The wind drives the

cloud very gently.)

यत् तत्409

nouns कामं परिभ्रमति । (He wanders at will.) सुखं जीवति ।

(He lives happily.) राजाभूदशरथो नाम । (There was a king, Dasaratha

by name.) d. Other cases: Some adjectives, notably चिर, (long)

(as of time) and दूर, (far) mayoccur adverbially

with other सुप् endings, e.g., अखिलेन तच्छोतुमिच्छामि । (I want to hear that in its entirety.)

एतद्विस्तरेण कथयतु भवान् । (Tell it, sir, at length.)

चिरेण भवन्मुखं दृष्टं मया । (I see your face after a long time.)

शनैः शनैर्वदति । (He speaks very slowly.)

उच्चैर्वद । (Speak loudly!)

दूरादिव भवद्वचनं शृणोमि । (I hear your words as it were from afar.)

चिर may mean "for a long time' or after a long time' in any एकवचन case but the प्रथमा. Examples:

चिरं

चिरेण चिराय

चिरात्

- जीव (live long)

चिरस्य चिरे However, the 9001 and H674 are not common.

NOTES जाज्वल्यमान see 18.26 = यङन्त Take 1 here in the sense of 'host, multitude'; 1470 then construes as लोकेन सह त्वया 'byyou, even with a host of.' The last three words constitute a simile.

## 22 Readings from the वाल्मीकि-रामायणम्

22.0

The following verses are excerpted from the first of the वाल्मीकि रामायण. In the passage the divine sage नारद, in re sponse to desilta's questions, relates, very concisely, the tale of <TH. It is on the basis of this narration that is hift, inspired, discovers poetry and composes the रामायण.

The verses selected complete the story in outline, from the abduction of Hial to the end. Due to the conciseness of the passage some of the references will be obscure. Notes have been provided to clarify various problems. Note that syntactic units frequently cross verse boundaries.
