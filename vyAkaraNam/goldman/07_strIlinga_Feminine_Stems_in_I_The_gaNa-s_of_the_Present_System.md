7.2

The Present System The present system comprises an extensive complex of tenses, modes, and participles, which together make up the most sig nificant coherent portion of the Sanskrit verbal system. The "present" system is the basis for the लट् (lat-present indica

: 7.4

7.5

tive), the 5 (lan—imperfect), the MTC (lot-imperative), the विधि लिङ् (vidhi lin optative) and the वर्तमाने कृदन्त (vartanane krdanta–present participle). These together make up a great portion of verbal forms actually in use. All these different forms are said to belong to a single system because of the fact that regardless of which personal endings, modal signs, or verbal prefixes they may involve, they all share a common feature. All are formed from a special verbal base derived from the verbal roots, UTC -s (dhātu-s), by several pro cesses. This base is called the present stem. The 10-8 (Gaņa-s) of the Present System A few verbal roots, UC -s (dhātu-s), have no forms belonging to the present system. The great majority of roots, ETC -s (dhātu s), however, do have such forms. These roots, HTC -s (dhātu s), are divided into ten separate conjugations classes, called 107-s (gana-s) according to the way in which their present stem, the base for conjugation, is formed. To form their present stems, the roots belonging to the differ ent 10-s (gana-s) may be augmented in: one or both of two ways: 1. By the addition of a characteristic TT (gana) sign.

a) It may be (and is in eight of the ten 30-s (gana-s])

suffixed to the root. b) It may be (as in the third 1 [gana]) prefixed into the

root. c) It may be (as in the seventh 7 (gaña]) infixed to the

root itself. 2. By Jo (guņa) (see 3.7) of the root vowel in some or all of

the forms of the paradigm. The 10-s (gaņa-s) are ten in number and are so numbered by traditional grammarians. They are also given names based on a typical root for each (gaña). Thus, the first class is named for the root (Vbhū—to be) and is called agit (bhvādigaña) or the MM (gaņa) consisting of 4 (Vbhū), etc. We can call this the 470 (bhū gaña).

7.6

115

7.7

"a" Tu-s (gaņa-s) and "non-a" 141-(gana-s) Although the fact is not indicated by any grouping in the tradi tional ordering, the ten 10-s (gaņa-s) fall typologically into two basic groups: 1. Those whose qui (gana) sign either is or ends in the

vowel 31 (a) and is suffixed to the root, and 2. All other 7-s (gaņa-s). The major difference that should be grasped between the two groups is that roots of the first group (the "a" group) form a present stem that, once formed, is invariable throughout the conjugation(s) regardless of changes of number and voice, while roots of the second group (“non-a") form stems that are liable to variation, by a change either in the root or in the gana

7.8

7.9

7.10

Strong and Weak Forms Roots of the “non-a" Tu-s (gana-s) have, in sharp contrast to those of the "a" Tu-s (gana-s), stronger and weaker stem forms. The basis for the strong/weak distinction in the "non-a" T-s (gana-s) is quite simple and regular and must be memorized at once. The only strong forms are: 1. The three cool ala P 4C (ekavacana parasmaipada)

persons of the c (lat) and 5 (lan-imperfect (Lesson

8]).

2. The प्रथमपुरुष एकवचन परस्मैपद (prathamapurusa ekavacana

parasmaipada) and all 3714454 (uttamapuruṣa) forms (परस्मैपद [parasmaipada] and आत्मनेपद [ātmanepada] re gardless of number) of the DTC (lo-imperative (Lesson

11]). In other words, with regard to the SC (lat), the only conjuga tion that you need concern yourself with at the moment, only the three 100097 RAG (ekavacana parasmai pada) forms are strong. All others (i.e., oazh 3764146 (ekavacara ātmanepada] and all Tao (dvivacana) and 6° [bahuvacana]) are weak.

116

7.11.

The traditional list of the Tu-s (gana-s) is given below. Each is listed with its traditional number and name, the 2 (gana) sign, the stem strength, if any, and the 944 Pocah Me (prathmapuruşa ekavacana lat) of the root which names the

1° (gaña). The problems of the individual -s (gaņa-s) will be discussed separately below.

The remainder of this lesson deals in greater detail with the individual 7-s (gana-s), their irregularities, and the most com mon and useful roots of each class. Where indicated, particular roots, with their present stem, should be learned immediately.

118

7.14

The first, or (Vbhū gaña) This is perhaps the most important of all the 10-s (gaña-s). Most of the verbs that we have already encountered belong to this class. To form their present stems, 31 (a) is suffixed to the root, whose vowel takes 1 (guna) (3.7) if possible (see 7.16). The personal endings are added to this stem. Examples:

El + 37 → 245 + fa → isia Vtyaj + a → tyaja + ti → tyajati (he, she, it abandons)

4 + 37 +47 +34 + 4 + 37 + fat → Hvala Vbhū + a bho + a → bhav + a + ti → bhavati (he, she, it is) (see 3.13.b)

Da + 37 → +31 +→ ada Vvrt + a + vart + a + te → vartate (he, she, it is/exists)

F +31 57 +31 +374 +37 + → spila Vji + a → je + a → jay + a + ti → jayati (he, she, it conquers) (3.13.a)

G + 37 → G + → Gift Vvad + a + vada + mi → vadāmi (see 4.22) (I say)

7.15

Irregular Roots of the L 79 (Vbhū gaña) a. A few roots with nasalized vowels lose the nasalization

in the formation of the present stem.

Example: दंश् → दशति Vdams → daśati (he, she, it bites)

सर्पस्तं दशति । sarpas tam daśati. (The snake bites him.)

b. Two very important roots of the 4 m (Vbhū gaña) lose

their final consonants and replace them with the conjunct TBD (-cch-).119

Examples:

गम्

रामो गच्छति । rāmo gacchati. (Rāma goes.)

Vgam

यम् सीता यच्छति । Vyam sītā yacchati. (Sītā gives.) Learn these roots.

c.

The root HG (Vsad—to sit) has an irregular present stem, Hic (sida). Example: अर्जुनो विषीदति । arjuno vişīdati. (Arjuna sinks down in despair.)

d. The two important roots FT (Vsthā—stand, be located)

and (pā—drink) are conjugated on the basis of the ir regular stems fas (tişțha), and 196 (piba), respectively. Examples: Gal: Ati Rahi devāḥ somam pibanti. (The gods drink soma.)

रामश्च सीता च कुत्र तिष्ठतः । rāmaś ca sītā ca kutra tişthatah? (Where are Rāma and Sītā standing?)

7.16

Exceptions to regular Ju (guna) strength There are two instances in which a root vowel, even though it should be subjected to Jul (guna), is exempt from this strength ening.

1. A long root vowel followed by a final consonant. 2. Any root vowel followed by a final consonant cluster. Examples:

5114 (1P) → silaha Vjīv (1P) (lives) jīvati (he lives). The root vowel $ (i) is by rule 1 above not subject to Jul (guna) even though first Tu (gana) roots normally take it.

120

Pam (10P) → Paralla Vcint (10P) (thinks) → cintayati (he thinks). Here 3 (i) is ex empt from Ju (guņa) by rule 2 even though tenth 1 (gaña) roots normally take it.

7.17

7.18

The second, or 3TC (Vad gana) This 2 (gana) is sometimes referred to as “root class" be cause of the fact that its present stem is the same as the root. This results from the fact that this 1 (gaña) has no character istic Tu (gana) sign. The root vowel takes y (guna) in the strong forms (7.10). Internal Consonant H (Sandhi) In this and several of the other non-a Tu-s (gana-s), the present stem may often end in a consonant, which must then be fre quently placed in juxtaposition with an initial consonant of an ending. This brings into play a number of internal HU (san dhi) rules. Some of the more important of these rules will be mentioned here and at other appropriate points. a. A voiced non-aspirated 8421 (sparsa) before any non

voiced of (vyanjana) (as in absolute final position) is changed to its corresponding non-voiced 6427 (sparsa). Example: fac + fet + afa Vvid (2P) (know) + ti → vetti (he knows)

b. A FYR (sparśa) or a nasal of the Great asof (dantya varga)

following any sound of the qua qof (mūrdhanya varga) or the HR 3647 (mūrdhanya ūşman"s") is changed to its corresponding A (mūrdhanya) sound. Example: fim + → Stee

Vdvis (2P) (hate) + ti → dvești (he hates)

121

c. The sound ($), when it precedes the sound (s), is gen

erally changed to (k). The following 7 (s) is then (by rule 3.58) changed itself into (s). Example: face + → Vdviş (2P) (hate) + si → dvekși (you hate)

d. A nasal before H (s) is changed to 37tar (anusvāra).

Example: 6 + → ETH Vhan (2P) (kill) + si → hamsi (you kill)

e. Root final when it precedes any 435A (vyañjana) other

than a nasal or the 37:29 7 (antahstha "v"), is treated as though it were the sound (k) in the same position. Example:

+ af Vvac (2P) (speak) + ti → vakti (he speaks)

E + f + alat Vvac (2P) (speak) + si → vakși (you speak) (See c. above)

7.19

Some Examples of Second Tu (gana) Forms Examples: 5 + fa → efa Vi (go) + ti (strong) → eti (he goes)

3 + : → 54: Vi (go) + mah (weak) → imah (we go)

3 + 31 → Vi (go) + anti (weak) →yanti (they go) face + → Stat Ndviş (hate) + si (strong) → dveksi (you hate)

122

द्विष् + अन्ति → द्विषन्ति

Vdviş (hate) + anti (weak) → dvişanti (they hate) fac + → area Vvid (know) + mi (strong) → vedmi (I know) fac + a: → fag Vvid (know) + vah (weak) → vidvah (we two know)

7.20

Irregular Roots of the 3G m (Vad gana) a. By far the most important root of the J14 (gaņa) is 316L

(Vas-be). It is irregular in that it loses its initial vowel in weak forms of all parts of the present system except the 076 (imperfect) and loses its (s) before the (s) of the 4244° 3° RHYC (madhyamao ekao parasmaipada) ending. This paradigm, given at 4.24, should by now have

been memorized b. The very common root ? (Vbrū-speak, say) takes the

additional vowel $ (i) between its strong stem and an ini tial consonant of an ending. Examples: ब्रवीमि bravimi (I say)

ब्रवीति bravīti (he says)

but:

4 brūmah (we say)

बते

brūte (A) (he says) The consonant (v) is inserted before endings beginning with a vowel and the root vowel is shortened. Examples: बुवन्ति bruvanti (they speak)

123

बवते bruvate (A) (they speak) (see 4.22.e)

This root does not occur outside the present system. C. The roots EC (Vrud—weep) and 494 (Vsvap-sleep) insert

5 (i) before consonant initial endings. Examples: स्वपिति नृपः । svapiti nạpah. (The king sleeps.)

कस्माद्रोदिषि देवि । kasmād rodiși devi (Why are you weeping, lady?)

d. The common root & (Vhan-kill) is rather peculiar in that

before consonant initial endings (except [m] and 7 [v]), the weak stem loses its 7(n), while before an vowel initial endings, the weak stem loses its vowel 31 (a). In the latter case the initial (h) is changed to q (gh). The paradigm is as follows:

G (Vhan) (2P)

वचन

एक vacana → ekao

O

dvi

पुरुष

puruşa प्रथम prathamao

हन्ति

घ्नन्ति ghnanti

हथ hatha

5-4: hanmah

7.21

The third, or 71 (Vhu gana) The third Tu (gaña) is unique in that its (gana) sign is prefixed to the root. The sign is even more striking in that it

124

has no fixed form for the whole class but takes its form from the phonological structure of each root. It is in fact a sort of echo syllable or "reduplication," which the Indian grammar ians call 372H (abhyāsa), or repetition. General Rules of 3121H (Abhyāsa)

The basic rules of “reduplication" (which also apply to a num ber of forms outside the present system) are that the 3P3H (abhyāsa) syllable represents a part of the root. A root begin ning with a vowel will have an 3p2TH (abhyāsa) syllable con sisting of that vowel, or of the vowel and a following conso nant. For a root beginning with a consonant or consonant clus ter, the 37TH (abhyāsa) will consist of that consonant or the first consonant of that cluster, and the following vowel. Specific Rules for the & (Vhu gana) a. A root vowel generally appears in its short form in 3721H

(abhyāsa). Example: al (Vdā-give) →GGI (dadā) = present stem, but

7.23

b. Root vowel + (r) is changed to 5 (i) in 38-2014

(abhyāsa). Example:

(Vbhr-bear) or (bibhr) = present stem.

c. As is evident in the previous example, an initial aspirated

consonant is represented in 37H (abhyāsa) by its non aspirated counterpart: Example: U (Vdhāput) → GUT (dadhā) = present stem.

d. An initial Duda (kanthya-velar) is represented by the

Hoyou (tālavya-palatal) corresponding to it in voicing, while initial (h) is replaced by (i). Example:

(Vhu-sacrifice) → (juhu) = present stem.

125

7.24

Strong forms of the present stem show Jul (guņa) of the root vowel. Examples:

(Vbhr-bear) →

Panifa (bibharti–he bears)

Pau (bibhrmaḥ—we bear) & (Thu—offer as a sacrifice) → TEA (juhomi—I offer)

364 (juhumaḥ—we offer)

7.25

It is an important peculiarity of this 4 (gaña) that its roots regularly require the loss of the न् (n) of the प्रथम बहु° परस्मैपद (prathamao bahuo parasmaipada) ending, not only (as with other non-a 14-(gaņa-s]) in the 371CH1YG (ātmane pada). Examples: जुहोति juhoti (he offers)

juhvati (they offer)

बिभेति bibheti (he is afraid)

बिभ्यति bibhyati (they are afraid)

7.26

Irregular roots of the 10 (Thu gaña) There are two extremely common roots belonging to the GM (Vhu gaña) that require special attention and with which you must become familiar.

a. These roots al (Vdā-give) and UI (Vdha-place, put) are

alike in completely losing their root vowel in all weak forms. Examples: ददाति dadāti (he gives) (strong)

126

GCT:

dadmah (we give) (weak)

दधाति dadhāti (he puts) (strong)

दधति dadhati (they put) (weak) When the 4 (dh) of the weak stem 4 (dadh) comes di rectly before the (t), 9 (th), or (s) of an ending, it becomes a (t) and its lost aspiration reappears in the initial of the 3721H (abhyāsa) syllable. Example: YA: dhattaḥ (the two place)

7.27

The fourth, or faq u (Vdiv gaña) The Mu (gana) sign is 9 (ya). It is suffixed to the root, which takes no strength. Examples:

नश्यति Vnaś → naśyati (he is destroyed)

नश्यामि

naśyāmi (I am destroyed) Some common roots of this Top (gaņa) are:

→ Vkup (P) (be angry) kupyati (he is angry)

कुप

क्रुध्

क्रुध्यति krudhyati (he is angry)

Wkrudh (P) (be angry)

मन्

मन्ये

Vman (A) (think)

manye (I think)

127

7.28

7.29

The fifth, or I (vsu) and eighth, or (Ntan) 74-8 (gana-s) These two T-s (gana-s) are treated very similarly. The Tu (gana) sign of the (vsu) class is 3 (nu), and that of the (Vtan) class is 3 (u); but, as almost all of the roots of the latter end in 7 (n), the two conjugations show few differences. Rules for the I (vsu) and a 10-s (Vtan gana-s) a. The final vowel of the stem 3 (u) is subject to Jul (guna)

in the strong forms. Examples:

सुनोति 1974: Vsu (press) → sunoti

sunumah

तन्

तनोति

14: tanumah

Vtan (stretch) →

tanoti

b. The 3 (u) of the weak forms of either To (gana) may be

dropped optionally before the H (m) or q (v) of fào (dvio) and 6 (bahu°) endings. (vsu gana) roots with final consonants are an exception to this. Examples: CA 94 / 14 Vtan — anumaḥ or tanmaḥ

Vsu

→

sunuvaḥ or sunvaḥ

but 314

Vāp →

आप्नुमः āpnumaḥ (we obtain)

7.30

The most important roots of these 10-s (gana-s) to learn are:

Vkr (8P) (do, make)

Víru (5P) (hear, hear about, listen) आप Vāp (5P) (get, obtain) The first two are somewhat irregular. a. (Vkr) is one of the most common and useful roots in the

language and, like 1 (Vbhū) and 37 (Vas), must be memo rized. It is somewhat irregular in that:

128

i. It is the only root of the A 70 (Utan gana) that does

not have a root-final 7 (n). ii. Both its strong and weak forms are irregular in that:

a) Strong forms involve qui (guna) of both the root

vowel + (r) and the Th (gana) sign vowel 3 (u). The strong stem, then, is opel (karo).

Examples: करोति karoti (he does)

कशोषि karoși (you do)

करोमि karomi (I do)

b) In weak forms, the root changes to F (kur).

The weak stem, then, is (kuru). Example: कुरुतः kurutah (the two do)

iii. As a corollary to rule 7.29.b, weak forms of F (Hkr)

always lose the 3 (u) vowel of the Th (gana) sign before 7 (m) and (v) of fão (dvio) and 6 (bahu°) endings. Example:

kurmah (we do)

b. The roots (Váru) becomes I (Vśr) before the 7 (gaña)

sign. Thus the paradigm is yunta (śrņoti), Yuga: (śrņutaḥ), guap (śrnvanti), etc.129

7.31

The sixth, or T T (Vtud gaña) This alu (gana), like the 41 (Vbhū gana), has 37 (a) as its Tu (gana) sign and behaves just like that TT (gana) except that its roots never take ju (guna) before the fu (gana) sign. Example: नुद्

नुदति Vnud (push) nudati (he pushes)

7.32

a. A few relatively common roots of this m (gaña) are

strengthened before the app (gana) sign by the infixation of a nasal before, and corresponding to the root final con sonant. Examples:

मुञ्चति Vmuc (release) → muñcati

मुच

सिच

Vsic (sprinkle) →

सिञ्चति siñcati

विद्

Vvid (find) →

विन्दति vindati

b. The common root 59 (vis-wish, want) forms the present

stem şticcha). Example: इच्छामि icchāmi (I want)

7.33

The seventh, or a 79 (Vrudh gaña) Roots of this all (gaña) are relatively few in number and all end in consonants. The Tu (gana) sign is a nasal consonant, homorganic with the root-final consonant and infixed imme diately before it. In the strong forms, the sign is strengthened to the syllable 7 (na).

130

7.34

Internal Consonant H (Sandhi) The seventh 20 (gaña), like the second, presents a few prob lems of internal consonant HP (sandhi). The following rules are applicable: a. A nasal immediately preceding a F431 (sparśa) is changed

to the nasal of the same af (varga) as that F421 (sparsa). Example:

युज

Vyuj (yoke, join) + infix 7 (n) → (weak stem) out (yunj);

युञ्ज yuñj

-तः -taḥ

युतः → yuñktaḥ (the two join)

+

Rootfinal (1) of several roots that belong to this p (gana) is treated exactly like root final Z (c). (See 7.18.e) Example:

- 15979: Vyuj + -tah yuñkthah (you two join)

युज

c. i.

An aspirated Fyzf (sparśa) loses its aspiration when it occurs immediately before any +47 (sparśa) or 3,0477 (ūşman). Example:

रुध

रुन्त्से

rudh (Ā)

►

runtse (you block)

ii. If a root final voiced aspirate FYR (sparśa) (except as

in 7.26.b) precedes initial al (t) or 4 (th) of an ending, the (t) or (th) is voiced and aspirated. Examples:

Fa Vrudh (block, prevent) strong stem रुणध् (runadh) + ति (ti) → Bull (ruņaddhi-he blocks)

weak stem 54 (rundh) + a: (taḥ) ►

5-6 (runddhaḥ—the two block)

131

7.35

Some Examples of 4 T (Vrudh gana) roots: A few relatively common opit (Vrudh gaña) roots, with some examples are: y (Vyuj-join) युनक्ति (yunakti—he joins)

युज्मः (yuñjmaḥ—we join) E (Vbhuj—eat) भुनक्षि (bhunakşi-you eat)

भुञ्जन्ति (bhuñjanti—they eat) छिद् (Vchid-cut) छिनत्ति (chinatti-he cuts)

(See 7.18.a) forafa (chindanti—they cut)

7.36

The ninth, or yu (Vkri gaña) This 7 (gaña) has relatively few roots of common occurrence. The Mu (gana) sign is the syllable (ni) suffixed to the unstrengthened root. In the strong forms, the suffix is 71 (nā). The $ (1) of the weak stem is lost before endings beginning with a vowel. Examples: क्री क्रीणाति Vkri krīnāti (he buys)

क्रीणीमः krīņīmah (we buy)

क्रीणन्ति krīņanti

(they buy)

7.37

The most important and common root of the Tu (gana), I (Vjñā—know), is irregular in that it loses its own root-nasal 37 (ñ) before the 10 (gana) sign or, in other words, throughout its entire present conjugation. Example:

जानाति

जानीमः

जानन्ति jānāti,

jānīmah, jānanti, etc.

ज्ञा

Vjñā,

132

जानामि धर्मं न च मे प्रवृत्तिः । जानाम्यधर्म न च मे निवृत्तिः ।। jānāmi dharmam naca me pravsttiḥ. jānāmy adharmam na ca me nivịttiḥ. (I know what's right, but I don't do it. I know what's wrong, but I don't stop.) Memorize this example and the forms of this useful root.

7.38

The tenth, or T (Vcur gana) This Tu (gana) has very few roots. Its Tu (gana) sign is 377 (aya), which is suffixed to the root. It is thus like the other "a"

M-s (gaņa-s). The root vowel is strengthened by Jul (guna). Perhaps the most common root in this 10 (gana) is Ford (Vcint—think) (see 7.16.2). Example: चिन्तयति चिन्तयामि चिन्तयन्ति

इतो न किंचित् परतो न किंचिद् ___ यतो यतो यामि ततो न किंचित् । विचार्य पश्यामि जगन्न किंचित्

स्वात्पावबोधादधिकं न किंचित् ॥

There is nothing whatever here, nothing elsewhere.

Wherever I go there is nothing there either. When I think about it, I see that the world itself is nothing. There is nothing greater than understanding one's Self.

यदा नृपस्यानुज्ञामाप्नोति रामस्तदा मुनिना सह सो ऽरण्यं गच्छति । तत्र वने बहव ऋषयो वसन्त्याश्रमेषु । ते सर्वदा ध्यानमाचरन्ति यज्ञान्कुर्वन्ति च । तस्मिन्नेव काले बहवो राक्षसास्तान्मुनीन्बाधन्ते । राक्षसेभ्यो मुनीनां रक्षणायागच्छति रामः । बालको ऽपि स वीरो बहूनाक्षसानिषुभिर्हन्ति । यत्र यत्रायाति राघवस्ततस्ततो निशाचरा बिभ्यति पलायन्ते च । यत्र कुत्रापि राक्षसान्पश्यतो रामो लक्ष्मणश्च तत्र तेषां गात्राणि छिन्तः । यदा सर्वे निशाचरा हता निर्गता वा सन्ति तदा रामो वनं जहाति मिथिलां चा गच्छति । तस्मिन्देशे ऽतीव पण्डितो नृपो जनको नाम राज्यं करोति । जनकस्यातीव रमणीया कन्या सीता नाम । सर्वासां नारीणां श्रेष्ठा सेति चिन्तयन्ति जनाः । सीतया सह विवाहं करोमीति चिन्तयन्ति सर्वे नृपाः । ततस्ते मिथिलायां समागच्छन्ति ।।
