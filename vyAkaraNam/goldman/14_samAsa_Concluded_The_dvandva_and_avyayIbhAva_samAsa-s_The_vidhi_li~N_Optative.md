14.0

14.1

There remain two basic types of compounds to be examined. These are rather different from the preceding two types and their all applications, but they are extremely simple and require only the briefest treatment. The 6-6 H4 The first of these is the && HATH, sometimes given the racy title of “copulative compound." This compound differs from the basic कर्मधारय and तत्पुरुष types in that it does not consist of sets of pairs but is simply a stringing together of any number of nouns, which in ordinary syntax would be connected by the conjunctive particle 7 or, in rare cases, the disjunctive particle al. Since the items are simply listed, there is no grammatical subordination of one member to another. Still, the formation of the && is the same as that of the others insofar as prior members lose their 94-s or case endings.

a. The gender of a && is the same as that of its final

member. Thus:

सीतारामौ = सीता च रामश्च (Sītā and Rāma)

14.2

सुतकन्ये = सुतश्च कन्या च (son and daughter)

b. Number is determined not by the number of members of

the compound but by the number of things represented by these members, thus cayet (the god and the man), but

4511: (gods and men). There is no limit to the number of members in a &-&, e.g., देवासुरगन्धर्वपिशाचराक्षसाः (The gods, asuras, gandharvas, piśācas, and rākşasas).

242

14.3

In some cases, especially when a pair (द्वन्द्व) of nouns is

closely associated, it may be represented by a && with the नपुंसकलिङ्ग एकवचन ending. Examples: सुखदुःखम् (pleasure and pain) This a common technique for linking pairs of opposites. श्रुताश्रुतम् (what is heard and what is not heard) कृताकृतम् (what is done and what is not done)

14.4

द्वन्द्व-s may be included in extended समास-s. In the विग्रह of such compounds, the & -s are left intact. Examples: a. वीर्यबुद्धिसंपन्न (endowed with valor and intelligence)

द्वन्द्व

तुत विग्रह = वीर्यबुद्धिभ्यां संपन्न

b. सुखदुःखद (causing pleasure and pain)

द्वित विग्रह = सुखदुःखे ददाति

c. रक्तलिप्तहस्तमुखः (having hands and face smeared with blood)

तृत

विग्रह = रक्तेन लिप्तानि हस्तमुखानि यस्य सः

14.5

The order of words in a द्वन्द्व is not, as in other types of समास,of any syntactic significance. There are, however, a number of

243

rules laid down by the grammarians that regulate word order. The two most important such rules, in order of precedence are: a. A word signifying a person or thing of greater importance

or entitled to greater honor or precedence precedes one signifying someone or something less worthy. Example: ब्राह्मणक्षत्रियवैश्यशूद्राः (brāhmans, ksatriyas, vaiśyas, and sudras) (the four classes of Indian society in descending order)

b. If rule 'a' does not apply, a word with fewer syllables pre

cedes one with more. Example: 31fetgach (14.3) (snake and mongoose)

14.6

When a kinship term ending in - - (10.0.i) precedes another such term or the word F: in a &&, its stem vowel is changes to आ. Example: H + P Mail art (mother and father)

14.7

te G : Elliptical Dual In a few cases, when two nouns, especially kinship terms, are extremely closely associated as a natural pair, the face of one of them may be used to express the & S. Example: Pri (=htalart) (mother and father)

14.8

The &-&, then, is perhaps the most rudimentary form of nomi nal compound. There is only one point worth stressing: despite the fact that when a && is subjected to love, all the members are in the same case, this type of H41 should clearly be distin guished from a URT HRH, for which this is also the case due to H46M .

244

14.9

14.10

FORINTH418 : Indeclinable Compound Another relatively common typeof समास is called अव्ययीभावसपास, or indeclinable (304) nominal compound. As the name im plies, these compounds function as adverbs. They are formed by the junction of an 3702146 (as prior member) and a nominal stem (as final member). The endings of the final members of these compounds are usu ally changed so as to conform to the 944-faciat 500 797.815 endings of nouns of the various stem finals. Some stem finals are, however, reduced. a. Final members ending in -37 take the ending -374 though

नपुसक nouns may take -अ. Final long vowels are shortened. Examples: 78 + 2014: → 7199744 (according to desire) ufa + 3174: → प्रत्यग्नि (facing the fire)

31f87154 (upon the king)

14.11 The prior member, or 3104146, most often belongs to one of

three categories: a. 3471

Examples: ufa + fart: (m) (day) faiga (every day)

371 +

4(n) (hair) —

31ta (lit., with hair, or fur, i.e., in the proper manner)

H4 + 3780 (n) (eye) →

H484 (before the eyes)

b. the form a (=HE) (together).

Examples: H + 014: (m) (anger) → H2144 (with anger) H +0:14: (m) (desire) → H2144 (with desire) # + 31167: (m) (respect) → HIGH (with respect)

245

c. a relative अव्ययपद, especially यथा (just as) and यावत् (to

the extent that). Examples: यथा + शास्त्रम् (authoritative text) यथाशास्त्रम्

in accordance with the sastras यथा + कामः (desire) यथाकामम्

in accordance with desire

यथा + विधिः यथाविधि

(rule, custom) in accordance with established practice

यावत् + जीवः यावज्जीवम्

(life) for one's whole life

यावत् + संवत्सरः (year) यावत्संवत्सरम् as long as a year, for the duration of

a year Sentences: समक्षं पश्य मे मुखम् । Look at my mouth which is before (your own) eyes.

सर्वे सर्वदा यथाशक्ति कर्म कर्तुमर्हन्ति । Everyone should always work according to (his) ability.

एतत्सर्वं मया यथाशास्त्रं कृतम् । I did all this in accordance with the sastras.

14.12 विधि लिङ् : The Optative Mode

The fare 5 is the last important conjugation to be based on the U-s of the present system. It is a mode of the present system, just as the cate, or imperative, is a mode, and it had two

major uses. 1. Prescription. In this usage, the लिङ् indicates that the

subject should, ought, must generally, or had better, per

246

LO1

er

form the action or undergo the state expressed by the ver bal root. As such, it serves a similar (injunctive) function as that of the St. The difference is that here the "com mand" is usually of a general sort.

Examples:

अपण्डितः पण्डितसभायां मौनं समाश्रयेत् । (In an assembly of the wise, a fool should resort to silence.)

VTT)

यो मोक्षमिच्छति स वनं गच्छेत् । (He who wishes liberation should go to the forest.)

स्थितधीः* किं प्रभाषेत किमासीत व्रजेत किम् ।

(How would a man of firm intelligence speak, how sit, and how move about?)

न वदेद्यावनी भाषां प्राणैः कण्ठगतैरपि । (One should not speak a Western language even to save one's life.) *See 21.3.h

2. Hypothesis. In this usage, the fs is used conditionally

to indicate either a state contrary to fact, or one which is probable but not certain. The first of these usages is most common in relative clauses, while the second is common in the sense of "might," "may," or "would." Examples: रामो यदि वनाज्झटिति नागच्छेत्तर्यहं यमलोकं गच्छेयम् । (If Rāma should not return at once from the forest, then I would die.) (Literally, “would go to Yama's realm.")

रामो वीरो न स्यात्कथं जीवेयुः पुरुषाः । (If Rāma were not a hero, how would men live?)

247

यः को ऽपीदं पुस्तकं पठेत्स शतयज्ञफलं प्राप्नुयात् । (Whoever should read this book, he would attain the fruit of a hundred sacrifices.)

यथा काष्ठं च काष्ठं च समेयातां महोदधौ । समेत्य च व्यपेयातां तद्वद्भूतसमागमः ।। (Just as two bits of driftwood might come together in the ocean, and, having met, might go their separate ways, just so is the coming together of living beings.)

यदहरेव विरजेत्तदहरेव प्रव्रजेत् । (On the very day that one turns away from the things of this world, one should wander forth [as an ascetic]).

14.13 The विधि लिङ् is unlike the other modes of the present system

(लट्, लङ्, लोट्) in that it is distinguished not by particular per sonal endings but by a special mode-sign that is inserted between the present stem (7.5) and, for the most part, the sec

ondary endings (8.9). 14.14 Mode Sign of the विधि लिङ्

The optative mode-sign is basically & for all forms except the परस्मैपद forms of roots belonging to the non-अ गण-s (2, 3, 5, 7, 8,9). For these roots, the mode-sign is 91. In the case of the 37 गण-s (1, 4, 6, 10), the mode-sign ई coalesces with the preced

ing अ of the गण-sign to form ए. 14.15 The various cases are best considered individually by voice

and by type of गण. a. परस्मैपद

i. अ गण-s

a. The mode-sign ई plus the अ of the गण-sign yield

ए, which is then the characteristic sign of the विधि लिङ् of the roots of these गण-s. The endings are the normal secondaryendings, but the प्रथम बहुवचन

248

ending is always -3: and never -377. b. The ए (गण-sign + mode-sign) is never allowed to

come into contact with an initial vowel of a per sonal ending (e.g., -अम्, -3:). Such contact is avoided by the insertion of between them. Examples: गच्छ + ई + अम् → गच्छेयम् (I would, should, might go.)

वद + ई + 3: → वदेयुः

(They would, should, might say.) c. Thus, the conjugation of VH (1P) in the fara fesse

would be:

एक

बहु प्र° भवेत्

भवेयुः म° भवेः भवेतम् भवेत उ० भवेयम् भवेव भवेम

भवेताम्

ii. non-अ गण-s

The mode-sign 9 is added to the weak form of the stem regardless of the usual strong-weak distinction of present stems. The endings are the same as for the अ गण-s, but the mode-sign loses its आ before theend ing 3:

Example: प्र + Vआप (5P) (attain)

एक द्वि

बहु प्र प्राप्नुयात् प्राप्नुयाताम् प्राप्नुयुः म प्राप्नुयाः प्राप्नुयातम् प्राप्नुयात

प्राप्नुयाम् प्राप्नुयाव प्राप्नुयाम

성평

ii. You should learn the paradigms of the two important ___ roots /अस् (2P) and Vकृ (8P). In accordance with (ii)

above, the foot of 374 is based on the weak stem,249

b.

which is . Thus, the paradigm is: go RICE FIGUR FY: etc. These forms are useful. FiEL means "maybe," "per haps," etc. V is, as always, irregular. Here it loses its final stem vowel 3 before the mode-sign.

Para Petary ory: etc. Fill out and memorize both paradigms. 31TH YG i. 37 Tu-s

The mode-sign is as at 14.15.a.i.a above. The endings are the regular 311646146 secondary endings, except that the उत्तम एक° has अ. and the प्रथम बहु° has -रन्, instead of and -37R, respectively. The 10-sign plus mode sign (=) is, as in 14.15.a.i.b., not permitted to come into contact with an initial vowel of an ending. Examples:

4 + $ +31 → (I should, would, might get.)

भाष् + ई आताम् → भाषेयाताम् (They (two) might speak.)

ii. non-31 1-5

The mode-sign is always added to the weak stem. Since most 311 CHRYG forms are weak anyway, this is not as surprising as it is in the RAYE forms. As in i. above, the mode-sign is set off from a following vowel by य. Example: 405 + $ + 34 → positi (I would, should, etc., eat.)

14.16

The 3rait fast, or the Benedictive Grouped by the grammarians with the fato fois, but not formed from the present stem, is a somewhat rare conjugational mode

250

known as the 3172fir fois, or optative of blessing. It is used as the name implies mainly for uttering blessings or prayers. Its detailed formation is complicated and need not concern the beginning student. However, its 5145 ° forms may be encountered occasionally. Examples: भूयात्

भूयास्ताम्

भूयासुः May it be! May those two be! May they be!

EXERCISES

Translate the reading into English. List and identify all fos (optative) forms and substitute for them the corresponding te (imperative) forms. Translate the following into Sanskrit (See English-Sanskrit Glossary at end of lesson):

1. If a man would experience bliss, let him go to the forest

and there sit long in meditation. 2. Having left the city and become a muni, how then should

I speak to you, friend. 3. Are all brāhmans men of stabilized mind? How should

I know? It is not known to me whether they are all sages

or not (use यत् and न वा and इति). 4. Having done what, might men attain liberation? A man

should do what is written in the śāstras. Thereby he may

become liberated. 5. If I should not see the faces of Rāma and Lakşmaņa (use

&-&) again, I should surely be afflicted by great sorrow. 6. Let Lakşmaņa go with Sītā and Rāma (use ) if he wishes

to fulfill (use V) truth and duty (UH, use 56). 7. If they were not afflicted by birth, old age, and fear of

death (use &6), men might be happy. Moreover, (3119 a) having experienced disease, poverty, sorrow, and disas ters (use &-&), they would be of agitated minds.

251

Memorize the verse beginning यथा काष्ठम् (from 14.12) and be prepared to recite it in class.
