12 Nominal Stems in इन्; समास (Nominal Composition)


12.0

The suffix -5 is used freely in Sanskrit to form adjectives or nouns that indicate that the thing denoted by the word to which the suffix is added is possessed by, or in some way an attribute of, the word that the newly formed adjective modifies. a. The suffix is normally used with noun stems in -31 or -371

and replaces the final vowel. Examples: हस्तः (hand) + इन् →हस्तिन् (possessing a "hand"=elephant)

योगः (yoga) + इन् → योगिन् (yogi) b. A number of stems in-37C form a similar adjective by the

suffixation of fal, which is added to the stem.

Examples: तपः (asceticism) + विन् → तपस्विन् (ascetic)

मनः (mind) + विन् → मनस्विन् (wise) c. These forms are all पुंलिङ्ग or नुपंसकलिङ्ग, as the context re

quires. The corresponding Fifa 15-s are formed with the suffixes -- it and facil and are then declined according to the -ई paradigm (7.1). Examples: योगिनी (female yogi)

तपस्विनी (female ascetic, awretched woman) The declension of the पुंलिङ्ग and नपुंसकलिङ्ग forms is as follows: a. पुंलिङ्ग; योगिन् (yogi) विभक्ति एक

बह योगी

योगिनौ योगिनः द्वि० योगिनम् योगिनौ योगिनः

योगिना

योगिभ्याम्

योगिभिः योगिने योगिभ्याम् योगिभ्यः योगिनः

The remainder of the declension is the same as the पुंलिङ्ग.

12.2

This paradigm is quite regular. The only point that should be stressed and watched for is that the प्रथमा एक पुंलिङ्ग ends in ई Do not on this account confuse these forms with those of the -इor-ई declensions. This confusion is best avoided, as with the other consonant stems, by memorizing the stem form as

well as the प्रथमा. Example: योगिन् → योगी

12.3

समास: Nominal Composition Now that you have learned most of the major nominal declen sions in all their confusing variety of stems and endings, we come to a feature of Sanskrit that almost makes one wonder why one ever had to learn all this. The feature is 4471, nomi nal compounding, and is one of the most significant and distinctive characteristics of the classical language. It is the variety of nominal compounds that lends to classical Sanskrit much of its characteristic density, terseness, sonorousness, subtlety, and power. There is nothing about the formation of most Sanskrit H4TH-S that should present any great difficulty to a speaker of English. What sets Sanskrit compounds off from those of English and similar languages is the great freedom allowed in compound formation and in literary and scientific texts, the extraordinary

12.4209

12.5

12.6

number of words that may be brought together into a single compound. Nominal compounding is a technique whereby nouns may be related to one another without need for the conventional mark ers of syntactic relation (i.e., the nominal case-endings). Thus composition normally entails (loss) of 64-s (case-endings). Now, as mentioned above (4.44), it is precisely the presence of these 14-s, specifiers of syntactic relations, that makes word order a matter of considerably less significance than it is in

English. Therefore, if the 4-s are lost, one would expect that some other factor, such as fixed word order, would be required to prevent confusion. This is exactly the case in HHTH when ever there is a syntactic relation or some degree of subordination between two nouns. Except for one type of H418 (see Lesson 14), then, word order is rigidly fixed in the formation of H418-s. Word Order in #418- The word order is always the same. The principal noun (or adjective), i.e., the one which itself does not modify, and is not subordinated to any other word in the compound (or potential compound), is always placed last, with the immediately sub ordinated word preceding it. A few examples from English may serve to clarify this. In the compound "bluebird" (as sume for a moment that it refers to any blue bird), it is clearly the word bird that is principal and the modifier blue that is secondary. Therefore, in the sentence, “He sees the bluebird," bird serves as the direct object of the verb sees; it is directly related to something outside the compound. Blue merely speci fies something about bird. In the same way, in the sentence, “I took the horsecart," it is cart and not horse that is the direct object of take. If we reverse the order of the members of the compound, as in, “I took the carthorse," we have a completely

210

12.7

different sentence. In the first, horse is subordinated to cart and serves merely to specify a kind of cart. In the second, cart specifies a kind of horse. Thus, in both sentences only the final member has any reference outside the compound. This is the general rule in Sanskrit with respect to the two most im portant kinds of compounds.

Analysis of समास-s Analysis of compounds in Sanskrit, then, proceeds from the last member back to the first by a series of word-pairs. The technique is to establish the relation of the final member to the preceding member, and next, regarding the last pair as a single unit, to determine its relationship to the preceding member; and then to consider the relationship between the final triplet and the preceding member, and so on. Thus, the great length of some compounds should not be a cause for alarm. No com pound relation refers to more than two words. The following diagrams will illustrate how this is done. Each roman letter indicates one compound relation. Examples: 5779f agulgo (n) (See 12.14.) (Water sanctified by the bath of the daughter of Janaka.) 5114 - TR - FH - you – 36074 janaka — daughter — bath - holy – water

12.8

Techniques of Compounding In almost all types of H418, there is g, or loss of the case number ending, in all members except the last. The last member relates to things outside the HTH and is treated in gen eral as though it were uncompounded. Prior members of HH1H-s usually appear in their stem forms or in some alteration of these stem forms and do not show any change for number or case. Example: देवमित्रम् (=देवस्य मित्रम्) (The friend of god)

If we assume that the unspecified case-relation here is 9501 (genitive), the समास could equally well stand for देवस्य मित्रम्, देवयोर्मित्रम्, or देवानां मित्रम् (the friend of the god, two gods, or gods). Despite the 802, or loss of the case-number ending, the word ca has not lost its power (Plt) to express syntactic rela tion and number. However, here, as with most composition, we must rely on the context to determine what the lost ending was.

12.10

Types of समास-s There are several types of HHIH-s in Sanskrit. These are distin guished according to their foue, 'analysis,' which enables us to "dissolve" the compounds or paraphrase them by restoring what has been lost in composition. The two most important types of समास-s for the beginning stu dent to master are called कर्मधारय and तत्पुरुष. a. The कर्मधारय समास is extremely common. Its formation

and Tour (analysis) are extremely simple. i. In its most common form, it is composed simply of a

noun (or nominal item) to which is prefixed a modify ing adjective in its stem form. Hu at all compound junctures is extemal. Examples: समास

Meaning

विग्रह तुङ्गवृक्षः tall tree

तुङ्गो वृक्षः सुन्दरमृगः beautiful deer सुन्दरो मुगः प्रियमित्रम् dear friend

प्रिय मित्रम् हतराक्षसाः slain raksasa-s हता राक्षसाः त्यक्तभार्या abandoned wife त्यक्ता भार्या वृद्धतपस्विनी aged ascetic woman वृद्धा तपस्विनी अभिज्ञातशूरी two recognized heroes 371 Notice that the noun modified is in no way altered. It retains its usual gender and proper number and is used exactly like an uncompounded noun. Examples: तुङ्गवृक्षे वसन्ति बहुशुकाः । (तुङ्गे वृक्षे वसन्ति बहवः शुकाः ।) (Many parrots live in the tall tree.) मृतराक्षसेषु तिष्ठति रामः । (मृतेषु राक्षसेषु ...) (Rāma stands amidst the dead rākṣasa-s.)

b.

Aless common butstill frequently occurring kind ofकर्मधारय HHIH is that in which one noun is equated with another.

213

राजर्षि

Here again it is the prior member, which is subordinate, that “qualifies" the latter. Examples: समास

विग्रह

Meaning वाग्द्वारम् वाग् द्वारम् (speech-door)

a doorway which is of the

form of a speech सागरमेखला सागरो मेखला

(ocean-girdle) a girdle which is the

ocean राजा ऋषिः (king-sage, a royal sage) नरसिंहः नरः सिंहः. (man-lion) In this type of HRH, which is called the appositional or equational कर्मधारय, the two elements, being nouns, retain their inherent genders, just as when any two nouns are equated. Thus, in the compound वाग्द्वारम्, वाग्isस्त्रीलिङ्ग while

द्वारम् is नपुंसकलिङ्ग. 12.11 समानाधिकरण : Case Agreement

In either of the two types of कर्मधारय समास, the members, when subjected to four must be in the same case. This is because these members, whether their relationship is that of adjective and noun or of apposition, always stand in the same grammati cal relationship to a verb or other part of speech. Thus, for example in the sentence: दशरथो महान् राजा महान्तं हस्तिनं महति वने हन्ति । (The great King Dasaratha kills the great elephant in the great forest.)

a. दशरथः, महान् and राजा arein apposition and so must be in the

same case (प्रथमा) as कर्तृ of Vहन्. b. महान्तम् modifies हस्तिनम् , which is the कर्मन् of Vहन्, so they

must agree. c. महति modifies वने, the अधिकरण (locus) of the action of Vहन,

so they too must agree.

214

land

The sentence could be rewritten using कर्मधारय समास-s each one including a group of words in agreement: दशरथमहाराजो महाहस्तिनं महावने हन्ति । The Sanskrit term for this kind of equal governance of several words by a verb, etc., is called समानाधिकरण. This is not to be confused with the apparent agreement such as we saw in the sentence of the type: रामेण शरेण राक्षसो हन्यते । (Rāma kills the rākşasa with an arrow.) in which there is no समानाधिकरण relating रामेण, the कर्तृ, and शरेण, the करण (instrument), of the action of Vहन्. A कर्मधारय समास then, is one whose members are governed by the relationship

of समानाधिकरण. 12.12 The तत्पुरुष समास : Syntactic Compound

The other major compound type which must be mastered thor oughly is the so-called you, or syntactic compound. The तत्पुरुष contrasts sharply with the कमेधारय in that, as appears when subjected to fue, there must not be case agreement (समानाधिकरण) between the two members. If in विग्रह, the last member is cited in its en form, the prior member will be in any other case. The day may then be identified by the num ber of the case of the prior member. In fact, the षष्ठी and तृतीया are, in that order, the most common types of तत्पुरुष.

षष्ठी राक्षस

Type समास

विग्रह Meaning षष्ठी देवपुत्रः (m) देवस्य पुत्रः son of the god षष्ठी रामदूतः (m) रामस्य दूतः Rama's messenger

राक्षसकन्या (1) राक्षसस्य कन्या daughter of the raksasa षष्ठी सीतापुस्तकम् (n) सीतायाः पुस्तकम् Sita's book षष्ठी नरोत्तमः (m) नराणामुत्तमः best of men तृतीया निद्राबाधित (adj) निद्रया बाधित oppressed by sleep तृतीया नृपहत (adj) नृपेण हत s lain by the king पञ्चमी मरणभयम् (n) मरणाद्भयम् fear of death

215

सप्तमी वनवासः (m) वने वासः dwelling in the forest सप्तमी जलक्रीडा (1) जले क्रीडा sport in the water चतुर्थी पादोदकम् (n) पादाभ्यामुदकम् water for the feet द्वितीया स्वर्गगमनम् (n) स्वर्गं प्रति गमनम् going to heaven

12.13 Notes on the formation of तत्पुरुष and कर्मधारय समास-s

a. कर्मधारयor तत्पुरुष समास-s may either be nouns or adjectives,

as their final members are nouns or adjectives. Examples:

समास विग्रह (तृतीया तत्पुरुष) नृपोक्त नृपेणोक्त (adj) spoken by the king (षष्ठी तत्पुरुष) नृपवचनम् नृपस्य वचनम् (n) the speech of the

king

(कर्मधारय) (कर्मधारय)

तुङ्गवृक्षः तुङ्गो वृक्षः (n) the tall tree वृक्षतुङ्ग वृक्ष इव तुङ्ग (adj) tall as a tree

In fact, however, the placement of certain types of adjec tives in a HHR can very often tell us a lot even before we have understood the compound. i. The भूते कृदन्त functions most generally as an adjec

tive. Its placement in a HilH can be particularly helpful. a. If

F or other adjective occurs as the prior member of a समास, the समास is almost certain to be a $40K of the type discussed in 12.10.a.i. Examples: हतपुत्रः = हतः पुत्रः (m) slain son क्रुद्धब्राह्मणः = क्रुद्धो ब्राह्मणः (m) angry brāhman क्रुद्धबाह्मणो हतपुत्रं पश्यति ।

(The angry brāhman sees the slain son.)

b. If, on the other hand, the भूते कृदन्त of a सकर्मक root

occurs as the final member of a H1A, one is most likely dealing with a dy functioning as an ad jective. Moreover, since suchaभूते कृदन्तisa कर्मणि form, the समास is most likely to be तृतीया तत्पुरुष.

216

Examples: रामहत (adj) = रामेण हत slain by Rama शिष्यपठितानि (पुस्तकानि) = शिष्यैः पठितानि (पुस्तकानि) (books) read by students

ii. Since there is no limit to the number of members in a

H418 nor any restriction as to the types of compound functions possible within any one H4RH, there is no rea son why a 449 adjective so formed cannot then precede another noun and make a new compound and so on. Example: नृपहतपुत्रं पश्यति क्रुद्धबाह्मणः । (The angry brāhman sees the son slain by the king.)

शिष्यपठितपुस्तकानि न कदापि पठ्यन्ते ऽन्यैः जनैः ।

(Other people never read the books read by students.)

iii. A समास in which an adjective other than a भूते कृदन्त of

a सकर्मक root occurs as final member following a noun is very likely to be a HR4 adjective comparing some thing to the prior member in regard to the quality expressed by the final member. The word 59 (like) frequently appears in the fore of such compounds.

Examples: वृक्षतुङ्ग

वृक्ष इव तुङ्ग tall as a tree काककृष्ण काक इव कृष्ण black as a crow

12.14 Remember that the fate of compounds of whatever length is

carried out from right to left, one juncture at a time. Examples: (क = कर्मधारय; त = तत्पुरुष; तृ= तृतीया; ष= षष्ठी) समास

विग्रह नृप – हत – पुत्र → नृपेण हतः पुत्रः

क

तृत° (a son killed by a king)

217

जनक तनया स्नान—पुण्योदकम्

जनकस्य तनयायाः स्नानेन (Janaka's) (daughter's) (by bath) पुण्योदकम् (sanctified) (water)

.

तु त

•

षत

षत

(Water sanctified by the bath of the daughter of Janaka.)

12.15 One may refer to a compound as a whole by the term describ

ing its final juncture. 12.16 Certain words have reduced or altered forms when they occur

in समास-s. Following areafew important examples.

a. Stems in -अन्and-इन् lose their final -when they are prior

members of समास-s and appear as -अ or -इ stems respec tively. Examples: समास विग्रह राजपुरुषः राज्ञः पुरुषः (king's man)

आत्महत्या आत्मनो हत्या (suicide) हस्तिनासा हस्तिनो नासा (elephant's trunk) राजर्षिः राजा ऋषिः (king-sage) The word T5F (m) (king) loses its final when it is at the end of most कर्मधारय and तत्पुरुष समास-s, thereby falling into the -31 declension. Examples: दशरथराजः दशरथो राजा

(King Dasaratha) राजराजः राज्ञां राजा

(king of kings) राजराजस्य (servant of the king of kings [Kubera]) Stems in -अन्त् take their weak form (-अत्) when they are prior members of समास-s.

b.

218

Examples: भगवद्गीता भगवतो गीता (the song of the Lord) हनूमत्सन्देशः हनूमतः सन्देशः (Hanuman's message)

When the very important adjective महन्त् (see 11.2.a) is the prior member of a कर्मधारय, it always takes the irregular form महा. समास

विग्रह

Meaning महाराजः (m) महानाजा (great king) महामुनयः (m) महान्तो मुनयः (great sages) महादेवी (1) महती देवी (great goddess) महामिथुनम् (n) महन्मिथुनम् । (great sexual union

of Siva and Pārvati) महायानम् (n) महद्यानम् (great vehicle)

d. The pronouns have special forms when they occur as prior

members of तत्पुरुष समास-s (their only use in compounds). i. The उत्तम पुरुष and मध्यम पुरुष pronouns अहम् and त्वम्

are represented by their weit forms for the number intended, regardless of the case-relation intended. Examples: मन्मनः (मत्+ मनः) मम मनः (my mind) अस्मद्वियोगः अस्मद् वियोगः (separation from us) युष्मन्मित्रम् युष्माकं मित्रम् (your friend) त्वत्कृते तव कृते (for your sake) त्वत्स्नेहः त्वयि स्नेहः (love for you)

ii. The प्रथमा पुरुष demonstrative pronouns सः, तत्, and सा

always appear in the एक नपुंसकलिङ्ग, प्रथमा fom तत् re gardless of the number, case, or gender intended.

Examples: तत्पुरुषः तस्य पुरुषः (his man (servant)) तत्पतिः तस्याः पतिः (her husband) तद्रतः

तस्मिनतः (devoted to that)219

12.17

3446 4418 : “Reduced-word" Compounds Several facili dye-s end in reduced forms of bare verbal roots, which signify the agent of the action of the verbal root. The prior member is often the of this root. Since these final members are 3446-1, "reduced words," in that they have no forms independent of such compounds, the faut-s require the substitution of a finite verbal form for the last member. This form is usually the genry adhes in the number and voice required. Examples: Root

समास

विग्रह

Meaning Viac (2P) Safaq* (m) agafar I (knower of

the Vedas) शास्त्राणि जानाति । (knower of

the śāstras) (2P) F67 (m) Pati (slayer of

Vợtra) 191 (1P) 144 (m) te fuafi (drinker of

· soma) As the above examples show, the long vowels of roots are short ened to make the stem forms. Roots ending in short vowels have a final added in generating these forms. Examples: VFS (1P) $resista* (m) si salati (conqueror

of Indra) कृ (8P) लोकक्षयकृत्* (m) लोकानां क्षयं करोति । (destroyer

of the worlds) *(for declensions see 21.1.b., c.) This formation occurs with case relations other than Grital, no tably with the roots V=14, VFN and V54. V=T4 is reduced to T. Examples:

ut:

खे गच्छति (sky-goer (bird)) गृहस्थः

गृहे तिष्ठति (householder) पादपः

पादेन पिबति (foot-drinker (tree)) GES:

ब्रह्मणो जायते (born from Brahman)
