16 Non-गण Conjugations; The लट्, लङ्, and लुट् (Future System and the Conditional); कृत्य (Gerundive)


16.0

16.1

Thus far, all the finite verbal forms you have learned, with the exception of the artifot yet, have involved knowledge of the

10, or conjugation class, to which each US, or verbal root, belongs. These forms, the C, MS, and fuss are, more over, the only finite forms generated according to these M-s. The remaining verbal conjugations, then, whatever their own peculiarities, do not require that you know the m of a root in order to generate their forms. सेट, वेट, and अनिट् Roots With regard to the non-M conjugations, all Sanskrit roots may be classified according to whether or nor they require the vowel 5 between themselves and tense markers or endings that begin with any consonant except 7. Since I is an exception, the issue does not arise with regard to the कर्मणि प्रयोग. a. This particular is called by the Sanskrit grammar

ians, and all roots are then classified as # (with 5) or roots that require the 3 wherever possible, 3 Pc (without 56), roots that do not require 5, and ac, or roots that op tionally take the 3. The 31fe roots are rather more numer

ous than the others. b. It is this distinction that explains the seemingly sporadic

occurrence of the 5 before the agentive suffix - and the infinitive ending -तुम्.

The rules for which roots belong to which categories are complex and need not be learned at this point. The dis tinction, however, is an important one. Its existence should therefore be kept in mind. If this is done, the verbal forms

274

16.2

themselves, when learned, will show clearly the presence or absence of the 5. This will be seen, for example, in the

case of the cac conjugation introduced below. H14R C ATO E : The Simple Future Thus far, although you have learned several modes of verbal forms indicating "present time" and numerous ways of indi cating preterite or "past” time, you have learned no straight forward way of expressing future time. Sanskrit has several ways of doing this. The simplest, which may be used to indi cate immediate future, is simply to use the MC, or present in dicative. Example: भो बालक वनं गच्छ । तथास्तु गच्छामि । (Hey boy! Go to the forest. So be it. I (will] go.)

16.3

On the other hand, for more general expression of future time, Sanskrit has two distinct verbal conjugations. The most im portant of these and the one more frequently used is also the simplest. It is called सामान्यभविष्यत्काले लट्, or"लट् in the sense of general future time." The term HIHR1, "ordinary, general," is used by the grammarians in an attempt to distinguish the usage of this form from that of the other future (see 16.11), but in fact no such distinction is observed in the literature. Formation of the ac a. The stem is formed by the suffixation to a verbal root,

of the tense marker -24. i. Before this markera root vowel takes 2° if capable of it. ii. In case of # roots, and optionally in the case of ac

roots, the tense marker is preceded by the vowel 5. In this case the # of the marker is changed to (3.58). The future stems of such roots then typically end in

-Grey iii. To the future stems thus formed are added the same

primary endings used with the लट्.

275

iv. The final 37 of a 2 stem is treated just like the final

37 of any 34--141 stem. Examples: Root

लट् forms Va (P) (give) Greifa (he will give) V17H (P) (go) facut (I will go) 144. (A) (think) tient (they will think)

Va (P) (do) sert: (we will do) v. 10th Tu roots form the 2 from the present stem. All

10th गण roots are सेट. Examples: VER (P) (steal) arproefa (he will steal) चिन्त् (P) (think) चिन्तयिष्यामि (I will think)

16.4

Derfor print of the ac The 2<, like most conjugations, has corresponding 04101 and Ha seri-s. But, like all conjugations not formed from the present stem, the ¢ has no special for or a stem. The कर्मणि and भावे प्रयोग-s then, are distinguished only by the fact of their always requiring the 31764-146 endings. In the case of roots ( -s) ordinarily conjugated in the 3116H146, there is no difference between corresponding कर्तरि and कर्मणि or भावे प्रयोग forms. Examples: Root VEEN (1P)(stay) <TH ad finua paik)

147 # FEIRA (Ha). (Rāma will stay in the forest)

VESY(A) (gain) a festa e (alle) (fl)

(He will gain nothing; Nothing will be gained.)

16.5

सन्धि and the लट् The formation and usage of the C2C are so simple and regular that they present few difficulties. There are, however, a few

276

U rules and other sound changes that should be noted here. Some of these have been introduced before but are repeated so as to refresh your memory. a. 3111c roots ending in consonants present a number of in

stances of internal consonant Hmu since no vowel inter venes between their final consonants and the of the 2 marker. Before of the future tense marker: i. Voiced E421-s change to their corresponding non-voiced

F43f-s. Example: Root

लट् VAG (split)

भेत्स्य ति (he will split)

ii. Aspirate F4Rf-s are changed to their corresponding non

aspirates and rule i., if necessary, applies. Example: Root Va (obtain, gain) hera (he will obtain)

iii. cipou consonants and are changed to hand the is

changed to 9 (7.18.c). Examples: Root 1245. (abandon)

त्यक्ष्यति (he will abandon) दृश् (see)

द्रक्ष्यति (he will see)

(see 16.5.b.i) Vवच् (say)

वक्ष्यति (he will say) VGE (burn)

& (compare 7.26.b)

(he will burn)

iv. 7 of several roots, most notably vaa (1P) (dwell), is

changed to a. Example: Root

लूट Van (dwell)

वत्स्य ति (he will dwell)

277

b. Several other sound changes are to be noted.

i. In the 2c and some other forms requiring vowel

strength, like the infinitive (13.1.a), a few roots with medial # show instead of the regular ju i.e., 37).

Examples: Root Vदृश् (see)

द्रक्ष्यति (he will see) VEST (emit, create) fa (he will create) v (move, creep)

a (he will move)

लट्

ii. A few roots are strengthened by a penultimate nasal.

Example: Root

लट् VAZ (4P) (perish) 75&fà (he will perish)

16.6

लट् of Some Important Roots Learning the following examples will give a sense of the eas ily recognizable form of theç of some common roots. a. 3tfore roots are more common than a (and ) roots. Some

typical examples are: Vदा (give) दास्यति (he will give) VEET (stand)

स्थास्यति (he will stand) VETI (know)

ज्ञास्यति (he will know) V215 (leave) त्यक्ष्यति (he will leave)

दृश (see)

(he will see) Vलभ् (get) लस्यते

(he will get)

द्रक्ष्यति

b. HC roots, however, are quite common and include some

that you must remember. v (do) करिष्यति (he will do) Vų (be) भविष्यति (he will be) VT (go) गमिष्यति (he will go) हिन् (kill) हनिष्यति (he will slay)

278

For at roots, of course, two forms are possible. Thus: निश् (perish) नक्ष्यति/नशिष्यति (he will perish) Vक्षम् (pardon) शंस्यति/क्षमिष्यति (he will pardon)

16.7

The following sentences illustrate the use of the future:

किं भविष्यति किं भविष्यतीति चिन्तयन्तः सर्वे शिष्याः परीक्षाशालामुद्विजन्त

आगमिष्यन्ति । (Thinking, "What will be? What will be?" all the students will come, trembling, to the examination hall.) यद्यहं जनकतनयां त्यक्ष्यामि तर्हि कस्मिन्नगरे स्थास्यतीत्यवश्यं मस्यते रघुकुलनन्दनः । (The bringer of joy to Raghu's race will certainly think, "If I abandon the daughter of Janaka, in what city will she stay?'')

मरणानन्तरं कुत्र गमिष्यति राक्षसः । यत्र न किमपि द्रक्ष्यति श्रोष्यति वा तत्र गमिष्यति । (Where will the rākşasa go after death? He will go where he will neither see nor hear anything.)

16.8

भविष्यत्काले कृदन्त : Future Participle A future participle may be made from the 2 stem in a way precisely analogous to the formation of the present participle of an अ गण stem (15.6). Examples: Root

Participle Stem vai (P) दास्यन्त

भू (P) भविष्यन्त युध् (A) योत्स्यमान Example: ग्रामं गमिष्यन् पुरुषो व्याघ्रमपश्यत् । (The man about to set off for the village saw the tiger.)279

16.9

16.10

अतिपत्तौ लृङ् : The Conditional Classical Sanskrit has a special tense formation specifically reserved for hypotheses or situations contrary to fact. This is called 3ta4all 25, or "25 in the sense of nonexistence, non coming to pass (31104fet:)." This is actually of rather rare oc currence and is included here only because its formation, once the 2 is learned, presents no difficulty whatever. The 25 is formed from the future stem, exactly as the 5 (imperfect) is formed from the present stem. The stem is pre ceded by the augment 37 and followed by the appropriate sec ondary ending (8.9). A few examples will suffice: Root

लट् लङ् गम् (P) (go) गमिष्यति अगमिष्यत् (he would have gone) भाष (A) (speak) भाषिष्यते अभाषिष्यत (he would have spoken) Vत्यज् (P) (leave) त्यक्ष्यति अत्यक्ष्यत् (he would have left)

The form, when it occurs, is used in reference to situations that are hypothetical or that are flatly contrary to fact. Example: रामर्थतवाभविष्यद्रावणः सीतां नैवाहरिष्यत् । (If Rāma had been there, Rāvana would not have abducted Sītā.)

16.11 386 ( a) Hoteles ce : The Periphrastic Future

The second of the two future formations is considerably less common. Its formation is peculiar in that it is periphrastic, or made up of two distinct forms. One of these forms is nominal and one verbal. This peculiarity is enhanced by the fact that in the most frequently used person, the gems, the finite verbal form is omitted. 16.12 Formation of the e

a. The C of a given verbal root, except in the ho form,

consists of a sequence of: i. an agentive noun derived from the root, ii. the IT form of the root V377 (2P) (be) agreeing in

number and person with the one of the root.

n

SOI

280

b. The agentive noun is formed by the addition of the suffix

- to the root, strengthened by Ju. The formation of the noun is discussed at 10.0-3. Its use is as follows. i. Its प्रथमा एक° पुंलिङ्ग form (ending in-ता) is used for all

मध्यम and उत्तमपुरुष forms regardless of number and gender. a. Examples: Root Agentive Noun

(8P) (do) कर्तृ → कर्ता गम् (1P) (go) गन्तृ → गन्ता Vभू (1P) (be) भवितृ → भविता

b. मध्यम and उत्तमपुरुष forms:

Root

कु कर्तास्मि (कर्ता + अस्मि)

गन्तासि (गन्ता + असि) Vभू भवितास्वः (भविता + स्वः)

(I will do) (you will go) (we two will be)

ii. प्रथमपुरुष forms differ from those of the other persons

in that the finite form of 375 is normally omitted. Since without this form it is impossible to indicate number, the remaining agentive noun normally takes its proper number. Examples: Root

कि कर्ता (he will do) गिम् गन्तारौ (they [2] will go)

भू भवितारः (they will be) Only context can help you distinguish these future

forms from the normal use of the agentive nouns. The complete paradigm of VaL would be:

एक द्वि बहु० प्रथम भविता भवितारौ भवितारः मध्यम° भवितासि भवितास्थः भवितास्थ उत्तम भवितास्मि भवितास्वः भवितास्मः

16.13

281

16.14

16.15

The e has no modes and occurs only in the RATYE , regard less of the conjugation of the underlying root. The is called 37841 (“not today') or BFT ("pertaining to tomorrow") to distinguish it from the more general C. This distinction, however, has not remained clear in the classical language. Example: हे सीते रामलक्ष्मणौ श्वो वनं गन्तारौ । त्वमपि गन्तासि वा न वा । (Oh Sītā, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa will go to the forest tomorrow. Will you too go or not?)

16.16

24 : The "Gerundive” or Prescriptive Passive Participle The "gerundive” (not to be confused with the "gerund" of 11.5) is yet another of those extremely useful “verbal adjectives" that we call participles. This particular participle is like the Ta कृदन्त of a कर्मणि or भावे application as it requires the कर्तृ of the action or state expressed by its verbal root to be in the daten fauft. It is not uncommon, however, to find the pool of a ge rundive in the 981. The participle, itself, is, when formed from a H ot root, in agreement with its . Moreover, it is "pre scriptive" in that the form indicates that the tale (thing modi fied) of this adjectival form is to be, should be, ought to be the object (where an object is possible) of the action or state expressed by the verbal root. Its force is very similar to that of the fara Rosor optative mode. Examples: ब्राह्मणो न केनापि हन्तव्यः । (A brāhman is not to be killed by anyone.)

नार्यपि न कदापि हन्तव्या । (A woman, too, is never to be killed.)

oma

रामेण राज्यं करणीयम् । (Rāma should rule the kingdom.)

282

महाभारतं दुर्विज्ञेयं देवैरपि । (The Mahābhārata is hard to understand, even for the gods.)

तन्न वक्तव्यं न मन्तव्यमपि । (That is not to be said, not even thought.)

तन्न मम कार्यम् । (I don't have to do that.)

a. The gerundive of 3744 roots is a participial equivalent

of the Harl. As such, its pe, if expressed, must be in the तृतीया (or षष्ठी) while the form itself, having no कर्मन् with which to agree, must be 9941, 306, H . Examples:

अत्र मया स्थातव्यम् । (Lit.,) (It is to be stayed here by me.) (I ought to stay here.)

भवतु । मया गन्तव्यम् । (Very well, I must go.)

न कस्यापि गन्तव्यम् । सर्वेषां स्थातव्यम् । (No one is to leave. Everyone must stay.)

i.

The gerundive of the root v4 is used idiomatically to indicate likelihood or probability. Here, as in other uses of the copula, the subject must be in the same case as its predicates. The case here is gaitei. Example: तेन राज्ञा भवितव्यम् । (He must be king.)

ii. The form Hacout by itself is frequently used in con

versation and dramatic dialogue in the sense of “very

likely," "probably," "undoubtedly,” etc. The gerundive, because of its prescriptive nature, can be used as a polite imperative with a TERI form of one of the 2nd person pronouns expressed or implied.

16.17

283

Examples: आगन्तव्यम् । (Come!)

गन्तव्यं यदि नाम निश्चितम् । (Go! If you have made up your mind.)

न भेतव्यं न भेतव्यम् । मयीह तिष्ठति न को ऽपि भयमनुभवतु । (Do not fear, do not fear. While I stand here, let no one experience fear.)

यद्यद्रोचते तद्ग्राह्यम् । यद्यन्न रोचते तत्त्याज्यम् । (Take what you like, leave what you don't.)

16.18 Gerundives, like other adjectives, may sometimes become

nouns.

Examples: vकृ → कार्यम् (duty, what is to be done)

पा → पेयम् (beverage, what is to be drunk.)

16.19

Formation of the Gerundive The gerundive may be formed from most roots by the addition of one of the following three suffixes: -य -तव्य -अनीय

The rules for treatment of roots before these suffixes are as follows: a. The suffix -य

The rules for the treatment of root vowels before - are complex and, unusually for Sanskrit, allow a good deal of freedom.

284

i. Root final vowels

a. final 31 always becomes .

Examples:

py (to be known) vपा

(to be drunk)

ज्ञा

b. final vowels other than 371 are treated variously.

They may be unchanged, subject to 1", or (less commonly) to is. In some cases, the same root

may show optionally any of these alternatives. c. If the vowel is subjected to ju or alco, then the

strengthened vowel may if I ore and must if 377 or 317 be treated as though it preceded a vowel (see 3.11). Thus: E → or 314

+ or 314

→ 379 377 → 31tą

Î

Examples: Root Gerundive VEG FRA / FRY (1) भू भव्य (T)

भाव्य (c)

(to be conquered) (to be)

d. If a final short vowel is not strengthened then the

consonant a often intervenes between the vowel and the suffix - (cf. 11.7.b.ii). Examples: VF files (to be conquered) Vaba gora (to be done)

ii. Root medial vowels

a. medial 37 is unchanged in some roots and length

ened in others.

285

b.

Examples: Root Gerundive

गम् गम्य (to be gone [to]) V225 21154 (to be abandoned) medial इ, उ, or a vowels are unchanged in some roots and subjected to qui in others. Examples:

द्विष् द्वेष्य (to be hated) युध योध्य (to be fought) Vगुह् गुह्य (to be hidden)

b.

Don't worry about the vagueness of these rules. You will come to recognize the common forms

with practice. The suffix -तव्य This extremely common suffix is added in each case to the same stem that precedes the-of the infinitive (13.1), or the agentive suffix -तृ (10.0). Examples:

भवितव्य (probably) कर्तव्य

(to be done) Vवच्

वक्तव्य

(to be said) मन्तव्य

(to be thought) गन्तव्य

(to be gone) पठ् पठितव्य (to be read) दा

दातव्य

(to be given) Vभुज

भोक्तव्य

(to be eaten)

मन्

Vगम्

The suffix -अनीय In general, root vowels are subject to put before this suffix, which is rather less common than the other two. Examples:

करणीय (to be done)

286

गम्

16.20

गमनीय

(to be gone) रिक्ष

रक्षणीय

(to be protected) Many roots, especially those ending in long 371, do not

form gerundives with this suffix. The difference of suffix does not change the meaning or use of the form. As can be seen from the above, one root may have several gerundives because of the three suffixes and the vari ety of forms possible before the suffix. On the other hand, not all roots actually occur with all suffixes, and in any case par ticular forms are often preferred. Examples:

कृ कृत्य, कार्य, कर्तव्य, करणीय जि जित्य, जेय, जय्य, जेतव्य भू भव्य, भाव्य, भवितव्य

16.21 Roots that only occur in the present system (e.g., 1921 [1P]

[see] and Vबू [2P] [say]) do not form gerundives or other non present participles.
