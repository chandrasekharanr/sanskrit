An extremely useful and simple indeclinable of an "infinitive" or dative "infinitive" value may be formed freely from virtu ally all roots in the language. a. Formation of the Infinitive

The characteristic and invariable marker of this formation is the suffix -94. Before this suffix, the root vowel is sub ject to JM. Between the root and the suffix the vowel 5 is inserted in some cases. The pattern for the occurrence of this 3 and the stem itself is the same in each case as with the agentive suffix तु (10.0.ii; see too, 16.1). Examples:

कर्तुम्

(todo) गम्

(to go) श्रोतुम् (to hear) एतुम्

(to go) पठितुम् (to read) पतितुम् (to fall)

(to be) Vवच् वक्तुम्

(to say) Vग्रह ग्रहीतुम् (to take) b. The common root Vदृश् (to see) irregularly forms द्रष्टुम् (to

see) (instead of the expected गुण form). Vसृज् (1P) (create)

forms स्रष्टुम्. (See 16.5.b.i.) c. The suffix -तुम् preceded by the vowel इ replaces, as in the

formation of the gerund (11.7.a.iii), the final 37 of the present stem of roots of the tenth गण. Example:

चिन्त् चिन्तयितुम् (to think)

में में

भवितुम्

13.2

As in English, the infinitive may be used with an auxiliary verbal or nominal-verbal form. It serves as an infinitive in the sense of “to + verb." It frequently occurs with auxiliary verbs indicating desire, will, intent, capability, undertaking, etc. V Jelg14 Conf I want to hear that. VITA ET TORI. They don't want to go there. सहन् रावणं हन्तुं व्यवसायं करोति |He resolves to kill Ravana. 1745 174734RI He starts to leave her. Note that this 31022446 can take a 24. like a finite verb or verbal adjective. a. An extremely common occurrence of this usage is with

the fifth or Vē u root 27 (5P) (be able). This root rarely occurs except as an auxiliary to an infinitive. It should be memorized at once. Examples:

अव + गम् तत्पुस्तकमवगन्तुं न शक्नोति । (He is not able to understand that book.)

गम् स्वर्गं गन्तुं कथं शक्नुमः । (How are we able to go to heaven?)

जीव् रामेण विना न जीवितुं शक्नुवन्त्ययोध्यावासिनः । (The inhabitants of Ayodhyā are not able to live without Rāma.)

b. The form also occurs freely with verbs of motion in a "da

tive-infinitive" sense of "in order to," "for the purpose of," etc. Examples: Vदृश् अपि मां द्रष्टुं भवानागतवान् । (Did you come to see me?)

vos निशाचराणां विनाशनं कर्तुं वनं गतो लक्ष्मणपूर्वजः । (Lakşmaņa's elder brother (Rāma) went to the forest to bring about the destruction of the niśācara-s.)

227

c.

The infinitive occurs frequently with the auxiliary verb V3TE (1P) "to be worthy or capable.” The phrase (infinitive + finite form of 376) generally serves as a polite impera tive. Examples: 311 +V074 HARMaghelai (You ought to come = Please come.) Vश्रु मद्वचनं श्रीतुमर्हसि कैकेयि । (Kaikeyi, you ought to hear my words. = Please listen Kaikeyi.)

Vभू रामो राजा भवितुमर्हति । (Rāma should be king.)

13.3

The infinitive may be used "passively," with no change in form, if its auxiliary verb is in the cito at

Examples:

a asi 70- I can't say that.

Vवच

Vवच्

da agi 3742 (921) I That can't be said

(by me). 1 6 hi del medi Rāma goes to kill

him. (See 4.38.)

Ei Application of HR and Ty

Anni

H4R-S is one of the most characteristically Sanskrit appli cations of nominal compounds. It is basically simple and even delightful in its conception, but often confuses students be cause they fail initially to grasp the idea. Before attacking these compounds it is necessary that a few points be under stood. Absolutely the most important thing to understand is that the alle is not a type of compound in the sense in which the कर्मधारय and तत्पुरुष समास-s are. To identify a compound as a बहुव्रीहि does not, as in the case of the कर्मधारय and तत्पुरुष, tell one

13.5

228

13.6

13.7

anything about the relationship between the members of the compound. Rather, the term acai indicates a secondary ap plication of a compound of the कर्मधारय or तत्पुरुष types. The term suggests the relationship of the whole compound (whose internal structure we must determine as discussed in Lesson 12) to some other word outside the compound. The usage of rail- is based on the fact that, in Sanskrit, any noun may function as an adjective with no special adjectival marker, when and only when it occurs as the last member of a कर्मधारय or तत्पुरुष समास. In other words, unless its last mem ber is already an adjective (see 12.13), any PTER or deyee compound can do double service both as a noun in its own right or, when used as a Caire, as an adjective. English has several examples that may illustrate this interest ing usage. a. When Paul Revere cried, "The redcoats are coming!", he

was not really referring to coats at all. What he really meant to say was that the men whose coats were red were on their way. The issue was of more than purely sartorial significance. In the same way, when we refer to someone as a loudmouth, bluestocking, blue-blood, yellow-belly, fathead, or redhead, we are not talking about mouths, stock ings, blood, etc. We mean people who possess the things mentioned. When we talk of paperbacks, redwings, large mouths, or sulphur-bottoms, we are speaking of books, birds, fish, and whales. In all of these cases, the com pounds (mostly कर्मधारय-s) serve as adjectives (विशेषण-s) modifying some other noun, which may be implied or ex pressed. In none of these cases would it be possible simply to use the uncompounded final noun as an adjective. We can call a man a redcoat or redcap, but not just coat or cap. The same situation prevails in Sanskrit. The only differ ence is that whereas in English this usage is restricted to a few compounds, most of which are internally of the HURA229

a

13.8

13.9

type, in Sanskrit the usage may be applied freely to almost any कर्मधारय or तत्पुरुष compound whose final member is a

noun. The structure of a dife-sis no different from that of the under lying compound in each case. It is only the fact that, in explaining both the underlying compound relation and the re lation of the whole compound to something outside it, differentiates the forms. The que must of course be supplied by us. aal H4TH-s can be easily identified by contextual criteria, and in many cases by formal criteria. a. The formal criteria are quite simple. Since the essence of

the al function is that certain nouns serve as adjec tives, then such nouns must behave as adjectives. They must take on the gender of the noun (outside the compound) that they modify. If, as is often, but (alas!) not always the case, the final member is of a different inherent gender than that of the noun being modified, then it must lose its inherent gender and be treated as an adjective of its own stem final. Thus, we may take the कर्मधारय समास “पीताम्बरम' (विग्रह-पीतमम्बरम्) ("yellow clothing"), which is नपुंसकलिङ्ग (neuter), and make it serve as an adjective modifying a go (masculine) noun (e.g., :) in the sense of the man whose clothes are yellow, the man with the yellow clothes. But in order to do this, the neuter 31024 must be brought into agreement with 954. This is done by treat ing it as an adjective in -34 (its proper stem final). Thus, while fraisley means, "yellow clothes, " HakkaR: can only mean, "the man or god with yellow clothes." By the same token, tahat can only mean "the woman with yellow clothes." In the same way, the षष्ठी तत्पुरुष—गजाननम् (विग्रह

R147,"the face of an elephant") must, if it appears as 151677:, mean "the man or god who has the face of an el

230

ephant." The adjectival treatment

inal nouns is occasionally confusing since nouns may take forms that they never have in their regular paradigms. Examples:

TH HEIG STT: (brilliant Rāma)

6946 Praha (Hanumān having accomplished his duty)

Here the nato nouns ts: and at must be declined as पुंलिङ्ग nouns to agree with रामः and हनुमान्. Thus तेजः is treated like the stems ending in 31: (e.g., 31157: [9.1.b]), while कर्मन् is declined like the पुंलिङ्ग stems ending in -अन् (e.g., 31164(8.5.a.i]). Thus, when a final noun of a compound appears with a gender other than its inherent gender, you

can be virtually certain that the compound is a बहुव्रीहि. b. If the inherent gender of the compound-final member is

the same as that of the noun being modified, we are still able to identify the site by the context, just as we know that in the sentence, “His father was a black-shirt," we do not intend to propagate a theory of spontaneous genera tion from filthy laundry. Take as an example the site compound "EGIE:" ("man with a lot of rice"). This is a Gaile application of the CHER HAKI"called" (m) (faut

), “much rice." Now if the compound is to serve as an adjective modifying, or referring to, a man, there will be no formal distinction between the two usages, since alle: is les to begin with. Even so, in the sentence 376415 H बहुव्रीहिर्वसति भार्यया सह । (“In our village a bahuvrihi lives with his wife"), it is clear that a person, not rice, is being referred to. However, since only rice appears to be men tioned as the subject of the sentence, there can be no doubt that the compound is used in a fait application. By the same token, in the sentence सा बहुव्रीहिं पचतीति श्रुत्वा बहुब्राह्मणास्तं allagane I (Having heard, “She is cooking bahuvrihi,”

231

many brahmans come to eat it.), it is clear that the simple

कर्मधारय is meant. 13.10 fue of a 4-

a. The analysis of a faire application of a Hurd must provide

two levels of information: i. It must serve as a focus of the underlying form (or forms)

i.e., Chura or dyan. It must clarify the relation of the H4n as a whole to whatever it modifies and, at the same time, indicate

clearly that the compound is a बहुव्रीहि. b. This information is provided by a conventionalized proce

dure for विग्रह of बहुव्रीहि-s. The steps of this procedure are as follows: i. Give the face of the underlying compound in the same

order in which the members appear in the compound. This is to establish, as in Lesson 12, whether the un derlying compound form is a कर्मधारय or तत्पुरुष. It is very important to note here that this step is done with out reference to the daile, or adjectival application of the compound. Therefore, the final member and any preceding adjective are given in their proper inherent

gender. ii. Immediately after this faus appears a form of the rela

tive pronoun—:, 46, or I. This is the unmistakable

marker of the बहुव्रीहि's विग्रह. The number and gender of this form are determined by the number and gender of the noun that the file 418 modifies. The case of the form is determined by the relationship of the un derlying members of the compound to the noun modified. This relative form, then, specifies the way in which the acil is to be understood. As in the case of the विग्रह forms of prior members of तत्पुरुष समास-s, this relative form may be in any case but the gen.

232

Again, however, as with dyear, the poot and diren

H -s, in that order, are most common, with the 46741 running a poor third, and the rest occurring less fre

quently. iii. After this relative form, its correlative appears either

in the case in which it actually occurs in the sentence in question, or in the 941 followed by this case. Of ten the 9441 is replaced or supplemented by a repetition of the whole (now completely analyzed) CEGIR HHH

in the प्रथमा. iv. So in the example R: ("he whose clothes are yel

low," epithet of Vişnu), the fou would proceed as follows: 443R 9 A: (

UR:) (yellow) (clothing) (of whom) (he) (is pītāmbarah) This is, "whose clothing is yellow is pitämbaraḥ." Here, the first stage is the four of the simple underly ing कर्मधारय, with the adjective पीत modifying and agreeing with the neuter 37-6R4. Since the noun which the compound modifies (Vişnu) is gt- and since the relation of this noun to the final member (315kh is possessive, the relative is in the षष्ठी एक°, पुंलिङ्ग. If the same form occurred in another case, we could, to be meticulously correct, add the appropriate case form of the correlative as the final step, but we could omit the qe form. Example: 11 HalRRI 74: 1 (Homage to Vişnu!) A typical face would be: Haytar ... If the phrase were: Halha : (a devotee of Visnu) The विग्रह could read: पीतमम्बरं यस्य तस्य..., but it would have to be clearly understood that the तस्य and the यस्य

233

13.11 a.

are neither in apposition nor agreement. The 24 refers to the relationship between अम्बरम् and विष्णुः and defines the file relation. The all, on the other hand, is simply a reference to the quite accidental fact that the compound happens to be in the 40t in this sentence. An appositional -4414 would be analyzed as follows: सागरमेखला (having the ocean for a girdle) = प्रथिवी (1) (the earth). विग्रह—सागरो (m). मेखला (1), यस्याः सा

(सागरमेखला) (she whose girdle is the ocean). As noted above (12.13.a.i), it is very common for कर्मधारय समास-s to have भूते कृदन्त-s of सकर्मक roots as prior mem bers. When such compounds are applied as बहुव्रीहि-s, it is usual for therelative pronoun of the विग्रह (13.10.b.ii) to be in the gate and to construe with the prior member. Examples: folding 4: (one who has conquered the senses) (conquered) (sense) विग्रहः जितानीन्द्रियाणि येन सः (जितेन्द्रियः) (he by whom the senses are conquered)

कृतकर्मा (one who has performed an action) (performed) (action) विग्रहः

कृतं कर्म येन सः (कुतकर्मा) (he by whom the action is performed)

पीतोदकी

(one [f] who has drunk water, (drunk) (water) or whose water is drunk) विग्रहः पीतमुदकं यया सा (पीतोदकी) (she by whom the water is drunk)

or

पीतमुदकं यस्याः साः (पीतोदका) (she whose water is drunk)

234

बहुव्रीहि समास-s of this type may be used like the भूते कृदन्त itself to denote a perfective or completed action (10.6.a). Example: हतमृगान् सिंहान्पश्यामि । (I see the lions who have killed the deer.) विग्रहः हता मृगा यैस्तान्

b. When the भूते कृदन्त is of an अकर्मक root or has no clear

04111 application, it is normally treated as any other adjec tive and the relative construes with the last member. Example: स्थितप्रज्ञस्य का भाषा ।

(What is the description of the man of established intellect?)

विग्रहः

स्थिता प्रज्ञा यस्य तस्य ।।

13.12

बहुव्रीहि application may also beeasily made of तत्पुरुष compounds. Example:

गजाननः (elephant-faced one = Ganesa) विग्रहः गजस्याननं यस्य सः ।

13.

e-s may be of any length and may occur, like any other adjective, as members of other compounds. Examples: बहुशोणितलिप्तशरीरः (whose body is covered with lots of blood) विग्रहः

बहुना शोणितेन लिप्तं शरीरं यस्य सः

हतपुत्रब्राह्मणः (brahman whose son has been killed or who has killed his son)

235

विग्रहः हतः पुत्रो यस्य/येन स ब्राह्मणः

13.14 As is clear from the विग्रह, a बहुवीहि समास may replace an entire

relative clause. Example:

शुद्धमना मे प्रियः । यस्य मनः शुद्धं स मे प्रियः ।

(The man of pure mind is dear to me.) 13.15 बहुव्रीहि-s are extremely common as names and epithets.

Examples: Name/Epithet

विग्रह बहदश्वः (having great horses) बहन्तो ऽश्वा यस्य सः नीलकण्ठः (having a blue throat = Śiva) नीलः कण्ठो यस्य सः हलायुधः (having a plowshare हलमायुधं यस्य सः

for a weapon = Balarāma) वीरसेनः

(having an army of heroes) वीराणां सेना यस्य सः मषिकवाहनः (having a rat

मूषिको वाहनं यस्य सः for a mount = Ganesa)

lunn

13.16 The द्विगु समास -

The ("two cow") समास is a kind of कर्मधारय of which the first member is a numeral. (For declension of numerals see 19.6.) This type of compounding is not normally used simply to enumerate things. Its major uses are: a. To denote aggregates or sets of things of which the num

ber is well known. The 2007 is always used regardless of the numeral involved. Examples: त्रिभुवनम्

(the three worlds) सप्तपदी

(the seven steps of a marriage ceremony)

(the three worlds) पञ्चरात्रम्

(the five nights of a certain rite)

(n)

त्रिलोकम्

236

b. As cai-s in the sense of names or epithets:

Name/Epithet

विग्रह दशरथः (having ten chariots) GEIT AT H: दशग्रीवः (having ten necks दश ग्रीवा यस्य सः

= Rāvana) त्रिलोचनः (having three eyes त्रीणि लोचनानि यस्य सः

= Siva) दशबलः

(having ten powers दश बलानि यस्य सः = Buddha)
