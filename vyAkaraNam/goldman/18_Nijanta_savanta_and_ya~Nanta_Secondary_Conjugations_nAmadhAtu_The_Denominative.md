18 णिजन्त, सवन्त, and यङन्त Secondary Conjugations; नामधातु (The Denominative)


18.0

18.1

18.2

With one exception, the characteristic signs of the various con jugated systems introduced thus far are alike in that they are markers only of tense or mode. In other words, the ten signs of the 10-s (7.4ff.), the -R4 of the future (16.2ff.), and the 328 (reduplication) of the perfect (17.Off.) suffice only to mark the general conjugation to which a verbal form belongs. They do not tell us anything about the action expressed by a verbal root except, in general, the relative time of the action.

The one exception is the 7, characteristic of the cuffon eeter (9.5ff.). This, unlike the others, tells us that the sentence or clause in which it appears is "passive." This special "passive" sign, however, is applicable only to forms which mirror the present system. Secondary Conjugations In addition to the conjugations discussed so far, Sanskrit has four special conjugations that, like the an i , indicate some thing about the action of a verbal root other than its tense.

These forms are also like the ashifor stems in -4 in that they have a distinctive sign that is suffixed to a special form of the root to form a distinctive stem. They differ from the c on stems in and other present stems in that, in many cases, this distinctive secondary stem may serve as the basis for forma tions outside the present system. The secondary conjugations, then, are not tenses but special derivative stem formations that in turn are used, like verbal roots, as the basis for various con jugations. It is for this reason that these forms are said to be "secondary" conjugations. It is also for this reason that the forms are identified in Sanskrit by their special stem-forming suffixes:

18.3

18.4

णिजन्त (ending in णिच्), यङन्त (ending in यङ्), सनन्त (ending in सन्). The forms are discussed below in order of decreasing impor tance. fost ( ): The Causative This is by far the most frequently used and important of the secondary conjugations. It is referred to either by its charac teristic suffix (-37, which is called for by the grammarians, or by the name ("causer," "impeller") for its function. a. A MISTR verbal form indicates that its grammatical sub

ject causes someone or something to carry out or undergo the action or state expressed by the underlying verbal root. Causative sentences, then, involve two decs: the subject of the causative (i.e., derivative) verb and the subject of the simple verb or the action or state expressed by the un derlying verbal root. Take, for example, two sentences: रामो वनं गच्छति । (Rama goes to the forest.) and दशरथो राम

Thai (Dasaratha sends Rāma (causes Rāma to go) to the forest). In the first sentence <14: is, of course, the te of the root V-14 (go) as he is the agent, the goer. In the second sentence, however, the finite verb is 744a, which is formed not from VT4 but rather from 1944 (cause to go), the णिजन्त derivativeof गम्. The कर्तृ of this form is दशरथः. Rāma remains the one of the underlying root V774 as he is

still the one who does the actual going. कर्तृ-s of Underlying Roots

of a finite Tus form is treated exactly like that of any other finite verbal form. It is in the term a s if the form is a कर्तरि प्रयोग and in the तृतीया if it is a कर्मणि प्रयोग. The treatment of the dies of the underlying or simple verbal root, however, requires some explanation, especially as it is different depend

ing on the transitivity of the underlying root.

18.5

Th

315

a. अकर्मक धातु-s

With णिजन्त forms of अक तु-s, including verbs of mo tion (see 4.38,41), the कर्तृ of the underlying root is placed in the द्वितीया विभक्ति. The णिजन्त forms even of अकर्मक धातु-s are themselves सकर्मक. Examples: Underlying root गिम् (go)

दशरथो रामं वनं गमयति । (Dasaratha makes Rāma go to the forest.)

स्था

(stand)

सेवकः फलं स्वामिनो हस्ते स्थापयति । (The servant places a fruit in his

master's hand.)

पत्

(fally

(fall)

वानरा महावृक्षान्पातयन्ति । (The monkeys fell the great trees.)

Vवस्

(dwell)

को मां वने वासयिष्यति । (Who will make me dwell in the forest?)

भू

(be)

दशरथो रामं राजानं भावयति । (Dasaratha makes Rāma king.)

b. In the case of सकर्मक धातु-s, the कर्तृof the underlying root is

generally placed in the तृतीया विभक्ति, although the द्वितीया is sometimes encountered. Examples: Underlying root हिन् (kill) सुग्रीवो रामेण वालिनं घातयति ।

(Sugrīva has Rāma kill Vālin.)

Va

(do)

रामो भरतेन राज्यं कारयामास । (Rāma had Bharata rule the kingdom.)

316

Vai

(give)

{THIERRA 57 4141 (Let the king cause his attendants to give money to the people.)

i. Roots whose fuiste stems convey the senses of teach

ing, or feeding, are exceptions. With them the cost of the underlying root is placed in the ladtall. (See 18.10.a.iii.) Examples: गुरुः शिष्यान्पुस्तकानि पाठयति । (The guru has his students read the books.)

राजा बाह्मणं भोजयति । (The king feeds the brāhman.)

ii. The roots V31G (2P) (eat) and VAIG (1P) (eat) are ex

ceptions to the exception. The subjects of their derivatives, आदय् (feed) and खादय (feed) are in तृतीया. Example: हे सूत नृपाश्वैः खादय । (O charioteer, feed the king's horses.)

18.6

18.7

Formation of the for The formation of the fursa is quite simple. In general the causative marker (UEL) is suffixed directly to the root, which is usually strengthened. Because of additional strength of the & in various forms, it is simplest to regard the causative marker as-374. The rules for root-strength are as follows: a. Initial or medial short vowels (except 37), if in a my syl

lable (see 17.6.c.i), usually take tu. Examples: Root vay (1) (be awake) atera (awaken) Vaz (6) (enter) RR (cause to enter) Var24 (1) (be arranged) $644 (arrange)

णिजन्त

317

Some roots, however, have l' only optionally. Examples: VTH (1) (shine, 147/14 (make beautiful)

be beautiful)

b. Initial or medial vowels in J6 syllables (except 31) remain,

as elsewhere, unstrengthened. Example: Root

णिजन्त Vgra (1) (kiss) EFR (cause to kiss)

y syllable, is usually length

c. Medial or initial 31, if in a

ened. For example: Root V245 (1) (abandon) 198 (1) (read) V3TE (2) (eat) V6 (2) (kill)

णिजन्त त्याजय् (cause to abandon) 4184 (teach) आदय् (feed) ar (cause to kill) (Note irregular form)

i.

But a number of roots show no lengthening. Examples: V=TH (1) (go) 14 (cause to go) V517 (4) (be born) Joy (give birth to)

ii. In some cases both forms (i.e., with 37 and 311) are

citable from the same root. Examples:

Vopn (1) (step) 42/14 (cause to step) 1214 (4) (be still) 244/201424 (calm, extinguish)

d. Final simple vowels, except 311, are subject to cha

Examples: Root

णिजन्त VŲ (1) (be) 492 (cause to be)

318

Vē (8) V8 (5)

(do) (hear)

FR4 1974

(cause to do) (cause to hear, teach)

e. Final 371 (and a vowels) are generally set off from the

causative marker by the consonant 4. This is a character istic sign of the first forms of roots with such finals. For example: Root

णिजन्त Vhen (3) (stand)

F41144 (place) Va (3) (give) 6144 (cause to give) VEI (2) (bathe F1194 (bathe (transitive])

(intransitive]) VETI (9) (know) 3144 (inform)

A few roots show not the 4, buty, before the 12. Root

णिजन्त 19 (1) (drink) TRR (cause to drink)

:

18.8

f. The root vş (2) (go), which would form 3114 by rule d.,

instead forms 311421 (a common verb meaning teach) when

preceded by the 34701 3779 Forms of the णिजन्त Since the 11577 is a secondary or derivative verbal root, it is not restricted to any one conjugation but may be used fairly freely as the base for the various verbal systems. Note that except for the कर्मणि प्रयोग (18.10), the परस्मैपद endings aregen erally used for the causative, regardless of the voice of the simple root. The Present System The SR, may serve as the base for a complete present sys tem, exactly analogous to those of the 37 atu roots of the present stem, formed by suffixing 37 to the suffix -37%. Therefore, the fusta present stem is characterized by the sign -377 and is conjugated exactly like roots of the tenth (VF) 14. genye

18.9319

लट्

एकवचन forms of the णिजन्त of the root vस्था (stand) (stem स्थापय्) will suffice as an example:

स्थापयति (he places) लक

अस्थापयत् (he placed) लोट

स्थापयतु (let him place) विधि लिङ् स्थापयेत् (he should place) वर्तमाने कृदन्त स्थापयन्त् (placing)

18.10 The कर्मणि प्रयोग

A regular कर्मणि प्रयोग stem may be formed from the णिजन्त by replacing the causative sign -अय् with the regular कर्मणि प्रयोग sign - 4. This is added to the root strengthened as for the caus ative (18.7), including the consonant where required (18.7.e). As usual with the कर्मणि प्रयोग, the आत्मनेपद endings are used. Examples: Root

कर्तरि णिजन्त

कर्मणि णिजन्त स्था

स्थापयति

स्थाप्यते /गम्

गमयति

गम्यते Vलम्

लाभयति

लाभ्यते श्रावयति

श्राव्यते

Vश्रु

a. When transforming कर्तरि प्रयोग into कर्मणि प्रयोग, it is neces

sary to be aware of the different treatment accorded the कर्तृ-s of सकर्मक and अकर्मक धातु-s (18.5). i. अकर्मक धातु-s

णिजन्त forms of अकर्मक धातु-s are themselves सकर्मक. The कर्मणि प्रयोग is formed just as for a simple सकर्मक verbal form. For example: कर्तरि कन्या पक्षिणं पञ्जरे स्थापयति । कर्मणि कन्यया पक्षी पञ्जरे स्थाप्यते । (The girl places the bird in the cage.)

ii. सकर्मक धातु-s

सकर्मक धातु-s are treated similarly. Here the कर्मन् of the forsta (= the panel of the underlying root) is put into

320

the प्रथमा विभक्ति, while the कर्तृ of the णिजन्त goes into the तृतीया विभक्ति.

Example: कर्तरि सुग्रीवो रामेण [रामं वा] वालिनं घातयति । कर्मणि—सुग्रीवेण रामो वालिनं घात्यते । (Sugrīva has Rāma kill Vālin.)

iii. Roots whose 5 stems convey the senses of teach

ing or feeding, may optionally take their causal object (कर्मन् of the णिजन्त) in the प्रथमा विभक्ति or द्वितीया विभक्ति. In the first option, the 04f7 of the underlying root is placed in the द्वितीया विभक्ति; in the second option, it is placed in the प्रथमा विभक्ति. (See 18.5.b.i.)

Examples: कर्तरि— गुरुः शिष्यान्वेदान् पाठयति । कर्मणि— गुरुणा शिष्या वेदान् पाठ्यन्ते । कर्मणि गुरुणा शिष्यान्वेदाः पाठयन्ते । (The guru has the students study the Vedas.)

कर्तरि—राजा ब्राह्मणमोदनं भोजयति । . कर्मणि— राज्ञा ब्राह्मण ओदनं भोज्यते । कर्मणि राज्ञा ब्राह्मणमोदनो भोज्यते । (The king feeds the brāhman rice.)

18.11 Other Formations

In conjunction with the following forms, it is important to note "that causative stems are always सेट् (16.1.a). That is, they al ways have the vowel 5 between them and the endings of the non-present forms for which the 3If distinction is rel

evant. 18.12 भूते कृदन्त

The G and its counterpart the past active participle (in -तवन्त) are formed by the suffixation of the ending directly to the root, strengthened according to 18.7, plus the इट.

321

भूते कृदन्त स्थापित

Examples: Root VFETT (stand)

दृश् (see) VITH (go) VF (do) (कुप् (be angry)

दर्शित

गमित कारित कोपितवन्त्

(placed) (shown) (banished) (caused to be done) (angered (transitive])

18.13 Gerund

a. Without उपसर्ग

The normal ending -rall, preceded by the 5C, is added di rectly to the causative sign -37%. Examples: Root

Gerund VFI (stand) Felirical (having placed)

(do) crfurall (having caused to do) (see) दर्शयित्वा

(having shown) Vor (go)

Real (having banished) b. With उपसर्ग

The normal ending - replaces the causative sign. Examples: Root

Gerund अनु + कृ (imitate) अनुकर्य (having caused to imitate) प्रति + स्था (be firm) प्रतिष्ठाप्य (having established)

c. When roots with medial 37 that show no strength in the

for Sin (18.7.c.i) are preceded by an 3487f, the ending is added directly to the USR marker. Examples: Root

Gerund अव + गम् (understand) अवगमय्य (having caused to

understand) अनु + जन् (be born after) अनुजनय्य (having caused to be

born after)

322

18.14

Infinitive As with the gerund without उपसर्ग, the infinitive ending -तुम् preceded by the 5C is added to the causative marker. Examples: Root

Infinitive Ven (stand) स्थापयितुम् (to place) VE (kill) घातयितुम् (to kill)

274 (go)

गमयितुम् (to go)

18.15 Gerundive

a. -doo

Like-14 and -rall, the ending -Hou preceded by 5C is added to the causative sign. Examples: Root

Gerundive VEET (stand)

स्थापयितव्य (to be placed) V14 (go) to (to be made to go)

b.

effor seint the ending - 7 replaces the

7 Like the - 1 of the causative marker. Examples: Root VRET (stand)

014 (go)

Gerundive स्थाप्य (to be placed) गम्य (to be made to go)

-अनीय The ending -3714, like-4, replaces the causative marker: Examples: Root

Gerundive VETT (stand) Fenerife (to be placed) VITA (go) गमनीय (to be made to go)

323

18.16

2¢ The future sign -स्य preceded by the इट् (→ इष्य) is added to the causative marker. Examples: Root

लूट VEET (stand)

स्थापयिष्यति (he will place) Vore (go)

h oura (he will cause to go) VF (do) dorproefa (he will cause to do)

18.17

18.18

The nominal suffix - preceded by FC is added to the caus ative sign. For example: Root VEIT (stand) F214Pal (he will place)

गम् (go) गमयितास्मि (I will cause to go) The nominal element may also serve as an agentive noun. fot The causative may form only the periphrastic perfect and in fact, accounts for the great majority of the occurrences of this form in the language. The periphrastic perfect is formed from the causative stem exactly as from the few simple roots that must take this form (17.18). Examples: Root

Fen (stand) F ITH GT/GR) (he placed) V (do) Reha (tarar) (he caused to do)

(hear) PATH (T/E9R) (he caused to

hear, he taught)

लिट्

18.19 Uses of the forta

As can easily be seen, it is extremely useful to have a simple grammatical form that can remove the subject of a verb one step from the action of a verbal root by making that subject the agent who impels another subject to act. This useful form is

324

exploited often in Sanskrit. Keep in mind that, in many cases, the fort may be translated by a simple verb in English. Try to translate in this way whenever possible, avoiding such phrases "cause to" unless you feel that they are either stylisti cally sound, or unavoidable in English. Examples: V4 (4) (be angry) कोपयति (he angers) V9 (1) (fall) पातयति (he fells) VFaly (2) (sleep) स्वापयति (he puts to sleep) 198 (1) (read) पाठयति (he teaches) VA (5) (hear) श्रावयति (he announces, he

teaches) VERT (3) (stand) Fellefa (he puts, places) V5 (7) (eat)

भोजयति (he feeds) Va (9) (know)

ज्ञापयति (he informs)

a. The PTSR of the common root VI (tula) may, without

change of form, be used both actively and passively in the senses of: i. to cause to see; ii. to show (i.e., cause to be seen).

The second usage may or may not take the 3C46146 endings and is especially common when the idea of one's showing oneself or something of one's own is intended. Example: ऋषिभ्यः स्वं विश्वरूपं दर्शयित्वा महेश्वरः कैलासं ययौ । (Having manifested his cosmic form to the rşis, Maheśvara went to Kailāsa.)

18.20 HR: The Desiderative

The HERT, or desiderative, is another derivative stem formed quite freely from most roots and causative derivatives. The form is considerably less common than the fish and is, in fact, chiefly represented by two derivative nominal forms.

325

18.21

The HER indicates that the subject of the form desires to do or experience the action or state expressed by the underlying root. It may be paraphrased by the infinitive of the simple root with an appropriate form of V54, etc. Examples:

रामो वनं जिगमिषति । = 1 Tagfold i (Rāma wants to go to the forest.)

भवतां सेवां चिकीर्षामि ।

NGHỈ Hai chinesIf I (I want to serve you (lit., do your service).)

Ses

18.22 Formation of the DER

The form is made by suffixing the characteristic desiderative sign-H (called HF by the grammarians), preceded in some cases by the 5€ to a verbal root. The 5C occurs more or less as it does with the infinitive. The rules regarding formation are for your reference. You need not memorize them. a. Before this sign (-8 or -54), the root is subject to 3pIH.

i. Thereduplication of consonants is mostly the same as

with the third गण and लिट् (7.22). ii. The treatment of vowels is somewhat different:

a. अ, आ, ऋ,ऋ,and इ,ई vowels all appear in the अभ्यास

syllable as 5. Examples: Root

सनन्त Stem VE (do)

Pacate (wish to do) VTH (go)

faring (wish to go) जि (conquer) जिगीष (wish to conquer)

(See 18.22.b.v.)

b. For # vowels when preceded by a labial conso

nant reduplicate as 3.

326

Example: VĘ (die)

en

(wish to die)

c. 3,37, vowels appear as 3 in the 372H syllable.

Example: VL (be) बुभूष (wish to be)

b. The root syllable itself is usually unchanged, but:

i. Final 5 and 3 are lengthened before 8.

Example:

Ves (conquer) srity (wish to conquer) ii. Final For becomes & or before a.

Examples:

कु (do) चिकीर्ष (wish to do)

(cross) fants (wish to cross) मृ (die)

(wish to die)

मुमूर्ष

iii. 5, 3, and #vowels always, when final, and optionally

when medial, take yo before -54. Example: Vवृध् (grow) विवर्धिष (wish to grow)

iv. Some roots with final -371 or -374 lengthen their root

vowel. Examples:

मन् (think) मीमांस (wish to think) (Note irregular lengthening of reduplicated vowel.) VE (kill)

fraih (wish to kill)

(See 18.22.b.v) V. Some initial al zou-s and show reversion in the root

syllable to puo-s after the 373 syllable. Examples: VEL (kill) feia (wish to kill)

(See 1.22.b.iv.)

327

जिगीष

(wish to conquer)

VEG (conquer) but VTI (know)

BISITA

(wish to know)

vi. A few roots, notably V3114 (obtain), va (give), and

VUT (place), have peculiarly contracted forms of 37218 and root. These forms are $79 (desire to obtain), fach

(desire to give), and the desire to place), respectively. All HER stemsend in 37 and are treated exactly like 37 pul stems in the present system. Examples:

Root लट्

लोट vo (do) fastera चिकीर्षत

अचिकीर्षत (he wishes (let him wish (he wished to do) to do)

to do) विधि लिङ्

वर्तमाने कृदन्त चिकीत्

चिकीर्षन्त् (he should wish to do) (wishing to do)

लङ्

d. Like the other secondary stems, the HERRI always forms its

future with इट्.

Examples: Vo (do facilla

facilidah (he will wish to do) (I will wish to do)

e. Like the other derivative stems, it forms only the peripitas

tic perfect. Example:

va (do) feltetnih

(he wished to do)

18.23

The most frequently encountered forms of the ER are two nominal forms that are peculiar to it. These are:

1. an adjective ending in -3 that indicates that the person or

thing modified by it is desirous of doing the action or un dergoing the state expressed by the simple root.

328

2. a Elif noun in - 371 that indicates the actual desire to do

or undergo what is expressed by the simple root. Both forms are derived by substituting the proper ending 3 or 311 for the final 37 of the HER stem. Examples: Root Stem Adjective Meaning Vēs (do) pareste foarte (wishing to do) vqe (fight) fra gyce (wishing to fight) VETI (know) fosila sisig (wishing to know,

curious) धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे समवेता युयुत्सवः । मामकाः पाण्डवाश्चैव किमकुर्वत सञ्जय ॥

श्रीमद्भगवद्गीता १.१ (What did my sons and the sons of Pāņdu do, gathered on the Kuru field, the field of dharma, eager for batile, O Sanjaya.) (MEMORIZE THIS VERSE) (See 20.11.j.) Examples: Root Stem Nominal form Meaning VTT (think) fisica e (the desire to know

curiosity) ) fact faster

(the desire to do)

b. A number of these nouns of type 2. take somewhat re

stricted meanings. Emples:

Root

Noun Meaning Vमन् (think) HITHI (inquiry, name of a

philosophical school of vedic

speculation) V319 (get) $441 (desire (esp. to get]) VEL (hear) TN (obedience) Valy (drive off) TCHI (loathing, repulsion) 1पा (drink) पिपासा (thirst)

भुज् (eat) बुभुक्षा (hunger)329

18.24

A folyett may be based on the ER stem. The form is generated by substituting the wife marker for the final 31 of the desiderative stem and using, of course, the 31164-146 end ings. Examples: V (do) I factoza I (It is desired to be done by me

[i.e., I want to do it).)

18.25

18.26

Vआप् (obtain) शुभमीप्स्यते सर्वैः । (Everyone wants the good.) HER of TUIER It is possible to form a secondary verbal derivative based on another such derivative. An example would be tarta, the प्रथम एक परस्मैपद

लट् of the सनन्त derivative of the णिजन्त derivative of the root V4(be). This would mean "he wishes to cause to be." Such tertiary forms are not at all common and need not be studied here. 152, 45 : The Intensive The last of the secondary verbal derivatives has two forms, the 452 and the Town. Called in English the intensive, or the frequentative, it indicates that the action or state signified by the verbal root is either repeated or of great force or intensity. Its characteristic is a reduplication marked by particularly strong forms of the 372d syllable. It may (45-) or may not (यङ्लुगन्त) have the stem sign य, called यङ् by the grammar ians. The intensive can be made from nearly every root in the language except roots of more than one syllable, roots that begin with a vowel, and roots belonging to the tenth M. Examples:

चेक्रियते

(he does repeatedly) देदीयते

(he gives generously)

a. Stem Formation

Both the यङन्त and the यलुगन्त require अभ्यास (reduplica tion) to form their stems. The rules for 37214 are generally

330

the same as those found for the third Tu roots (7.22) and for the fourt (perfect) (17.6). However, in the Sathe 4 is added to the root prior to reduplication and the root is sub jected to the same changes that are found with the passive (9.25) stem formation. In the 458 the reduplication is based on the root alone. In the intensive the reduplicated syllable is unusually strong. The strengthening of the re duplicated syllable is accomplished in one of three ways. i. Like the third am roots and the me, the first conso

nant of a root is reduplicated. But unlike these, the root vowel in the reduplicated syllable is strong: 37 and * reduplicate as 311, 5 and $ reduplicate as , and 3 and 39 reduplicate as 37. Examples:

Root Stem यङ्लुगन्त

विद् वावद् राहु जोहु

यङन्त

Vदा भू

देदीय बोभूय

ii. The entire root is reduplicated. This type usually in

volves roots that end in or or a nasal and that have 37 or as their root vowels. Note that the final nasal of the reduplicated syllable assimilates to the follow ing consonant and the root vowel Fis strengthened to either अर् or इर्. Examples:

Root Stem यङ्लुगन्त

चर् चर्चर् हिन् जङ्घन्

331

निम् कु

ननम् चर्कर् or चर्किर्

यडन्त

जिन्

जञ्जन्य or जाजाय (following i.)

iii. This type of reduplication is seen in about thirty roots,

most having final or penultimate 1 or in roots with final or medial F. Here the entire root is reduplicated, as in ii. above, but between the reduplicated syllable and the root and $ is inserted. Note here that the gen eral rules of reduplication are for the most part ignored. Example:

Root Stem यङ्लुगन्त

/गम् गनीगम्

यङन्त

Vवृत्

वरीवृत्य

b. The यङ्लुगन्त

This form of the intensive is similar to third Tu roots of the present system (7.21 ff.), although it is conjugated only in the RHY. While in theory any verbal form in the lan guage can be made from the 45-gull, its occurrences are most commonly found in the present system. When con jugated in the present system, the reduplicated stem of the intensive will take strengthening where necessary (7.9). In strong forms, between the stem and consonant initial terminations, ang may optionally be inserted (except when the reduplication follows type iii. above). Before this $, root final vowel will take T, but a root medial vowel re mains unchanged. Note that, like the conjugation of the 3rd गण, the प्रथम° बहु° लट् ending is -अति and the प्रथम° बहु°

5° will take 3:.

332

Examples: Vविद् वेविद् weak stem (to really know)

वेवेद् strong stem एक०

द्वि० बह वेवेत्ति / वेविदीति वेवित्तः वेविदति वेवेत्सि / वेविदीषि वेवित्थः वेवित्थ वेवेहि / वेविदीमि वेविद्वः वेविह्यः

अवेवेत् or अवेविदीत् लोट् वेवेत्तु or वेविदीतु विधि लिङ् वेविद्यात् वर्तमाने कृदन्त वेविदन्त

बोभू weak stem बोभो strong stem

प्रथम एक प्रथम द्वि प्रथम बहु° लट् बोभोति /बोभवीति बोभूतः बोभुवति

लङ्

The यङन्त The is the more common form of the intensive in the later language. To its reduplicated stem, the 31164-14G end ings are added. From this form of the intensive all verbal forms of the language can be made. Examples: Root

Stem Vदा देदीय प्रथम एक

लट्

देदीयते लङ्

अदेदीयत

18.27 TU : The Denominative

Another source of verbal forms in Sanskrit is the 71441, or noun-root, which, as its name implies, is a technique for deriv ing verbal forms from nouns. This technique is common in English. Consider such sentences as: "Stop clowning!";“We're just kidding around"; "I wish he would stop badgering me"; and so forth. No doubt you can think of many others. In each of these sentences a verb is generated from a noun as opposed to a “verbal” infinitive (in English). In the examples, the sub ject of the action is either behaving like the signified noun in

question or treating the object like that thing. 18.28 Forms such as these, not directly derived from a 7 (verbal

root) but from a 14. (noun), are common in classical San skrit. The basic meaning of these forms may be summarized as follows, in decreasing order of importance, letting X stand for any nominal item (noun or adjective): 1. a. become X (especially if X is an adjective);

b. act like, imitate X (especially if a noun) 2. a. turn into X;

b. regard or treat as X 3. desire X 4. do or perform X (especially if X is a noun expressing an

action)

Meanings 1 and 2 are by far the most important. 18.29 Formation of 214 Stems

The characteristic sign of the नामधातु is य, which is suffixed to nominal stems. Therefore, like the णिजन्त and सनन्त, नामधातु-s are treated just like the present stems of 37 71 roots. a. As one would expect, nominal stems with final 37 form

the bulk of 7 stems. Here 37 is added to the stem whose final 31 is either unchanged or lengthened. i. In practice, examples with lengthening are more

common, tend to take the 31764-146 endings, and are generally used in meaning 1.

334

Examples: Noun

नामधातु लट् Chl: (m) (crow) Alcohled jac (adj) (white) 74714

FHE: (m) (lion)

fHERA

Meaning (He acts like a crow.) (It becomes (turns] white.) (He plays the lion (i.e., is brave, etc.)) (He becomes (or acts) young.)

Jou (adj) (young) dhura

ii. Where the final 37 is unchanged, the forms tend to

take the 4G endings and are generally used in meaning 2. Examples: Noun

नामधातु लट् Meaning तरुण (adj) (young) तरुणयति । (He makes

[someone) young.) 1463 (adj) (white) Jocura (He makes (paints)

(something] white.) F#: (m) (lion) fügefa (He treats or regards

[something) as a

lion.) This distinction is a general one and not absolute. How ever, it is a fair generalization that stems with 31 and the 31144946 endings are 3744 and are used reflexively while stems with अ and the परस्मैपद endings are सकर्मक. Examples: सुवचनेन शत्रुमित्रायते । (Through kind words an enemy becomes a friend.)

सुवचनेन स शत्रु मित्रयति । (Through kind words he makes his enemy a friend.)

335

b. Nouns with other stem finals are relatively less common.

They are treated as follows: i. 34 usually remains unchanged.

Example:

(f) (girl) Daire (becomes a girl)

ii. 3, $ or 3, 5 become $or 3.

Example:

FRI (f) (woman) te (becomes a woman)

iii. Consonant endings usually remain unchanged.

Example: 74: (n) (homage) Hela (do homage)

iv. But final consonants may be lost, especially when the

middle endings are used in meaning 1. Here, the pre ceding vowel is treated as the final. Examples:

T56 (m) (king) Taila (he plays the king,

acts like the king) 31HE (f) (nymph) अप्सरायते (seems to be an

apsaras)

18.30

Use of the 714416 A common and characteristic application of the 14 injects irony into meaning 1. to indicate the fact that a person or thing is either incapable of acting like another, is foolishly acting like another, or in some way (ironically) appears to be another. Learn these two examples:

1. WHGRROR S9 Al TERCI (Even though perched on the pinnacle of a palace, a crow does not become an eagle. (i.e., No matter how high a fool may rise, he remains a fool.))

336

2. Hanah asetat Hancuri (When she attains sixteen years of age, even a sow becomes a nymph. [i.e., Any girl seems beautiful in the first blush of youth.))

EXERCISES

Translate the reading up to the sentence beginning with 2146 and identify by simple root and form all forms from secondary roots. Do the same for the reading from T440 to 3R al. Do the same for the remainder of the reading. Then translate into Sanskrit the sentences that follow using the fusta and HER wherever possible. Avoid, however, forming the HERI of fursa-s. Translate the following into Sanskrit (for vocabulary, see English-Sanskrit glossary below).

1. Having caused Rāma dwell in the forest, Kaikeyi will wish

to make Bharata king. 2. Thinking, “The prince wants to kill me," Lakşmaņa was

desirous of fighting. 3. Bharata, the knower of dharma, had his army bathe in the

Ganges. (Use periphrastic perfect.) 4. Lakşmaņa wanted to fight Bharata but was unable to an

ger Rāma. 5. A donkey does not become a lion by a roar; a man does

not become a hero by boasting. 6. The boy places the fruit at his teacher's feet. 7. The two boys should inform their mother and father of all

that happened. 8. Let the old sage teach(foT5ial of VD us the Rgveda. 9. Angering his father, the young child wanted to see his

mother. 10. His curiosity made him follow Rāma to the forest.

337

E.

Translate and memorize the following two verses (see vocabu lary for verses, below). 1. The first verse, from the Rāmāyaṇa, is a charming descrip

tion of the monkey Hanumān's delight upon thinking that he has found the kidnapped Sītā. It is especially valuable to memorize as it provides a fine drill for the perfect (लिट्), periphrastic perfect, imperfect (5), and causative (FOTSTRI).

आस्फोटयामास चुचुम्ब पुच्छं ननन्द चिक्रीड जगौ जगाम । स्तम्भानरोहविपपात भूमौ निदर्शयन्स्वां प्रकृति कपीनाम् ॥

2. The second verse, from भर्तृहरि-s"वैराग्यशतक" (hundred verses

concering withdrawal from the worldly life), illustrates two things, the aging poet's battle with craving and the नामधातुः.

वलिभिर्मुखमाकान्तं पलितैरङ्कितं शिरः । गात्राणि शिथिलायन्ते तृष्णैका तरुणायते ॥
