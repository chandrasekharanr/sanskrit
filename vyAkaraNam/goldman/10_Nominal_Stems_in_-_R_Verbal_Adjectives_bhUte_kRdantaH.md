10.0

There is relatively small but important group of nouns whose stems end in the vowel -- (). This group is divisible into two closely similar subgroups with slightly different declensions. Nouns of these declensions are unlike other nouns in final vow els in that they show the system of stem strength typical of consonant final stems. i. The first, and much more restricted, of these subgroups con

sists almost wholly of terms for kinship relations such as: gleg (duhitr) (f) daughter the (pits) (m) father HCL (bhrāts) (m) brother

HTCL (māts) (f) mother ii. The second, and larger, group consists of a series of quasi

adjectival agent nouns formed from many verbal roots by the addition of the suffix - (-tr), similar in meaning to the English agentive suffix -er. This suffix is either added directly to the verbal root or in some cases, is separated from the root by the vowel 5 (i). (See 13.1.a, 16.1.) In either case the root vowel takes ju if possible. Examples: root

agent noun (Vkr) (8P) do

ce(karty) doer, grammatical

subject f (Vji) (1P) win

stę (jetr) winner, victor 74 (Vgam) (1P) go

(gants) goer (Vbhuj) (7P) eat WTEE (bhokty) eater 24 (Vraks) (1P) protect o r (rakṣit;) protector This group also contains two kinship terms: 7 (naptr [m]-grandson) and FCE (svasr [f]—sister).

Gender of Stems in - (-r) a. The stems of group one (kinship terms) are grensor Files

according to the natural gender of the family member

named. This group contains no nouns of the नपुंसकलिङ्ग. b. The agentive nouns of group two, however, are quasi-ad

jectival in that they may take on the gender of a person or thing with which they are in apposition. When Faircas forms occur the ending - (-tr) is replaced by the ending - (-trī). These forms are then declined regularly accord ing to the paradigm for stems in - $ (ī) given at 7.1. Thus, one has to learn new declensions only for ytes and the less common नपुंसकलिङ्ग. The kinship term स्वसृ (svasr

sister) is, of course, Fritos. Declension of Stems in- (-) a. All stems of group one and yies stems (plus Fox-svasy)

of group two have very similar declensions with only two basic differences: i. Except for the gen 16°, where all these forms show

the ending -371 (-ā), the two groups differ in the strong forms (8.1); nouns of group one showing you of the stem final -37C (-ar), nouns of group two showing area

-3173 (-ār). ii. स्त्रीलिङ्ग nouns of grouponeand the noun स्वसृ (svasr

sister) of group two have as their frien og ending -#: (-th) in contrast to the corresponding ending -727

(ện) for tos nouns of both groups. b. Final - 7 (-1) of ayantes nouns of group two is treated as

regards length) exactly as is the final -3 (-u) of the a ss

nouns in final 3 (-u) (see 6.1.d). Paradigms of - 7 (-r) Stem Nouns a. The following paradigm shows the declension of fre (pitr

father) a typical is noun of group one. In addition the प्रथमा and द्वितीया विभक्ति-s of कर्तृ (kartr doer), a पुंलिङ्ग noun of group two, and of HTĘ (māts—mother) representing a Files noun of group one are given. Their parent through सप्तमी forms will follow the paradigm for पितृ.

Verbal Adjectives: Sanskrit Participles Despite its possession of a rich and complex system of verbal conjugations, or perhaps because of this, Sanskrit shows a marked proclivity for nominalization the substitution of nomi nal forms (सुबन्त-s) for finite verbal forms (तिङन्त-s). This is done through the use of a variety of declinable and indeclin able words, which are derived from the verbal roots. Perhaps the most versatile and useful of these words are the participles (कृदन्त-s). These words are remarkable in that they are adjecti val in form but verbal in function. As a result of this peculiar dual nature it is often possible for one word, formally a simple

177

adjective, to replace virtually an entire clause. Beginning stu dents are particularly fond of these forms as, through their use, they are frequently able to substitute an easily declinable adjective for a possibly obscure and almost certainly forgot ten finite verb. Participles, like any nominal forms, may be negated by the prefixing of -37 or before initial vowels, -371 (see 6.21). Example:

(vśru) (5P) hear a (śruta) heard

Pra (aśruta) unheard

10.5

10.6

R (Bhūte Krdanta): Past-passive Participle Now that the shit has been introduced, it is advisable to learn, in conjunction with it, the so-called past-passive parti ciple of Sanskrit. This participle is very common and useful. It is formed from virtually any , or verbal root, and de pending mainly on the transitivity of the root, has two basic applications. a. From Hash (transitive) roots, it forms adjectives that indi

cate that the nouns that they modify are the 24-s (direct objects) of the action expressed by the ET, or verbal root. Such a verbal adjective, agreeing (here as regards case, number, and gender) with the of its root, is of course a nominalization of the cito pirt. As such, its subject, if expressed, must be in the aire fauft. Examples:

राक्षसो हतो रामेण । Vhan (2P) (kill) rākşaso hato rāmeņa.

(The demon is (was) killed by Rāma.)

हन्

पठ् Vpath (1P) (read)

तत्पुस्तकं न मया पठितम् । tat pustakam na mayā pațhitam. (That book is (was) not read by me.) (I didn't read the book.)

178

तानि पुस्तकान्यपठितानि । tāni pustakāny aparhitāni. (Those books have not been read.) त्यक्तां कन्यां पश्यामि । tyaktām kanyām paśyāmi. (I see the abandoned girl.)

त्यज

Ntyaj (1P) (abandon);

छिद्

Vchid (7P) (cut)

किं नश्छिन्नम् । kim naś chinnam? (What of ours is cut? [i.e., What's it to me?])

Note that the action expressed by this usage of the

a is not necessarily "past." Rather one might say that it is "perfective" in that it is completed and not still in process regardless of the tense of the clause in which it

appears. b. From 37274 (intransitive) UTC -s, or verbal roots, it

forms adjectives that indicate that the nouns modified are the e-s (subjects) of the action of the Ung, verbal root. This action is frequently in the past. In other words, the participle serves as a nominalization of a simple past tense

(e.g., 5.) in the chair in Examples: i. This usage is especially common with verbs of motion,

which, although they have their locus of motion in the द्वितीया विभक्ति (see 4.38,41), are treated as अकर्मक धातु-s (intransitive roots).

रामो वनं गतः । सीतापि तत्र गता । Vgam (1P) (go) rāmo vanam gataḥ. (Rāma

went to the forest.) sītāpi tatra gatā. (Sītā also went there.)

गम्

311 + 91 ā + Vyā (2P) (come)

अहमप्यायातः । aham apy āyātaḥ. (I also came.)179

ii. From other 37931 roots the participle may be an ad

jective with no particular reference to time.

स्था

बहवो मुनयो वने स्थिताः । Vsthā (1P) (stand) bahavo munayo vane sthitā).

(Many sages are standing (located) in the forest.)

कुप् Vkup (4P) (be angry)

अतीव कुपितौ तौ द्वौ मुनी । atīva kupitau tau dvau munī. (The two muni-s are extremely angry.)

Vmț (6Ā) (die)

सर्वे वीरा मृताः । sarve vīrā mrtāḥ. (All the heroes are dead.)

जन्

Njan (4Ā) (be born)

त्वं कुत्र जातः । tvam kutra jātaḥ. (Where were you born?)

NY

By extension, such adjectives may come to be used as nouns in their own right. Examples:

बुद्ध । बुद्धस्य नाम गौतम इति । Vbudh (1P) (be

buddha (enlightened); enlightened)

buddhasya nāma gautama iti. (The Buddha's name was Gautama.)

वृध

Vvrdh (1Ā) (grow)

TE I TEGI flaga vsddha (fully grown, old); vệddhā kim avadat. (What did the old woman say?)

180

10.7

The formation of this useful participle is generally quite simple. The participle is invariably an -37 stem adjective. It is usually formed by the suffixation of the syllable - directly to the धातु, or verbal root. a. The root normally shows no strength.

किं त्वया कृतम् । Vkr (8)

kim tvaya krtam. (What have you done?)

Viru (5)

एवं मया श्रुतम् । evam mayā śrutam. (Thus have I heard.)

वि + स्मृ vi + Vsmr (1)

अद्यापि सा न मया विस्मृता । adyāpi sā na mayā vismrtā. (Even today, I don't forget her.)

अभि + भू abhi + vbhū (1)

शिवः कथमभिभूतः पार्वत्या । śivah katham abhibhūtaḥ pārvatyā. (How was Siva overcome by Parvati?)

b. If the root has a weaker form, the suffix is added to that

(cf.7.1.5.a). Examples:

दशति

दष्ट Vdams (1) dasati (bite) dasta (bitten)7.18.c

दंश

बन्ध

बध्नाति

बद्ध Vbandh (9) badhnāti (bind) baddha (bound)

This applies also to those roots which are weakened in the कर्मणि प्रयोग (9.27.d).

Examples:

इष्ट Vyaj(1) (sacrifice) ista (sacrificed)

य

181

वच

उक्त ukta (spoken, said)

vvac (2) (speak)

NOTE: The extremely common root va is especially common in 10 forms, an

न्त, उक्त, may refer either to something that was said or to a person addressed. This is often confusing. A good clue is that when the former is meant (something said), it is usually in the 794455 whereas a person addressed will require the participle to be in the gender proper to that person (gless, Fifs). Examples: यत्त्वयोक्तं तदसत्यमेव । yat tvayoktam, tad asatyam eva. (What you said, is surely false.)

एवमुक्ता राक्षसेन सीता भीताभवत् । evam uktā rākşasena sītā bhītābhavat. (Addressed thus by the demon, Sītā became frightened.)

c. A group of roots, some of them very common, ending in

nasals, lose the final nasal before the ending - Examples:

1H (Vgam) (1) go

Ta (gata) went 44 (Vyam) (1) restrain ya (yata) restrained 74 (Vnam) (1) bend, bow Ta (nata) bent <H (Vram) (1) delight, be a (rata) delighted

content & (Vhan) (2) kill 66 (hata) killed The following sound changes should be learned: a. In general, root final -371 or complex vowels become -

before the ending -A. Examples: 4 (Vpā) (1) drink

1a (pita) drunk (Vgai) (1) sing

afta (gita) sung; गीता (gitā) song

182

b.

But, the following important exceptions must be memo rized: i. Ti (Viña) (9) know if (jñāta) known ii. Fell (Vsthā) (1) stand fra (sthita) stood iii. a (1dā) (3) give GF (datta) given iv. UT (Vdhā) (3) place foa (hita) placed A root final voiced aspirate is deaspirated before 7, and the ais voiced and aspirated. (7.26.b) Examples:

4 (Vbudh) (1) awaken + a (ta) → 96 (buddha)

awakened FI (Vkşubh) (4) shake + a (ta) → gol (kșubdha)

shaken (vlabh) (1) obtain +a (ta) → ou (labdha)

obtained

d.

C. The roots CE (1) (Vdah—burn) and GE (2) (Vduh—milk)

are treated as if they were Ge (dagh) and 54 (dugh) re spectively, and the root F (4) (Vnah-bind) as if it were 74 (nadh). GE (Vdah) burn + a (ta) → GU (dagdha) burned

€ (duh) milk +a (ta) → Ghu (dugdha) milked TE (Vnah) bind + a (ta) → 76 (naddha) bound Several other roots with final are treated peculiarly: The root final before -a becomes and the is lost. A preceding or 3 vowel is lengthened. In the roots HE (1) (Vsah-endure, bear), and 16 (1) (Vvah-carry), the 37 vowel becomes 371. (See 20.6.i.) Examples: fase (Vlih) (2) lick → m (līdha) licked

E (Vruh) (1) climb, mount → 56 (rūdha) climbed,

mounted HE (Vsah) (1) endure → HC (sodha) endured TE (Vvah) (1) carry → ale (vodha) carried

183

e. See 7.18.e and 34.b for the treatment of the aloog root

finals and 3 before-a. Note also the change of 7 to after (7.18.b). 7 before or everywhere becomes Examples: y (Vyuj) (7) join F (yukta) joined fan (Ndvis) (2) hate → førse (dvişța) hated C (Ndré) see →

See (drsta) seen

10.9

Certain roots are set off from the - ending by the vowel 5. There is no comprehensive set of rules covering all cases of this use of 5. There are, however, certain root finals which generally require it. a. Root final conjuncts.

Examples: Parc (Wnind) (1) blame → Arca (nindita) blamed gra (Vcumb) (1) kiss → gfaa (cumbita) kissed

(vśañk) (1) doubt → iga (sañkita) doubted

b. Root final UR consonants.

Examples: 48 (Vpath) (1) read → od (pathita) read 494 (Vbhāş) (1) speak — WIE (bhāșita) spoken at (Vvas) (1) → (34uş) ► 31 (ușita) dwelt

dwell

c. Root final (1) or (v).

Examples: as (Vcal) (1) move → sita (Njiv) (1) live → Ha (Vsev) (1) serve →

efca (calita) moved sillata (jivita) lived, enlivened Naa (sevita) served

d. Root final nonvoiced aspirates.

Examples: free (Vlikh) (6) write → Praa (likhita) written

184

All 10th 14 roots take 5, which is added to the strength ened stem. fan (Vcint) (10) think → Papera (cintita) thought

(Vcur) (10) steal alia (corita) stolen

10.10 Many other finals may require $. These should simply be

learned as they are encountered. The following are important examples:

(Vpar) (1) fall → upda (patita) fallen C (Vkhād) (1) eat → CUCI (khādita) eaten 4 (Vkup) (4) be angry → Satua (kupita) angry 4 (Vbādh) (1) oppress → alta (bādhita) oppressed

10.11

10.12

The root T (9P) (Vgrah-take hold of) inserts $ before the ending. The correct form, then, is Tata (gshita—taken). A few roots form the EGR with the suffix -7. The largest class of these are roots ending inc. The before the 7 of the ending is peculiar in that it assimilates completely and be comes 7. Examples:

FOG (Ichid) (7) cut → Pes (chinna) cut

PTG (Vbhid) (7) split → (bhinna) separated, split

· (Vpad) (4) move → 45 (panna) moved There are other roots which take this ending and which are simply learned as encountered. Examples:

(Vp7) (9) fill →

pūrņa) full, filled (Vin) (4) waste away → stof (jirņa) wasted, aged (Vli) (4) cling →

लीन (lina)attached ET (Whā) (3) abandon → ta (hina) abandoned

(VF) (1) cross →

auf (tirņa) crossed
