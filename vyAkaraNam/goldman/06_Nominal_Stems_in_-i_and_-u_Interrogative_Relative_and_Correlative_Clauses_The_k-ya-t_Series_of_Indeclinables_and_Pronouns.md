Sanskrit has a large number of nominal stems in short - (-i) and short -3 (-u) whose declensions are closely analogous. The nouns are of all genders, although gros (pumlinga) and स्त्रीलिङ्ग (strilinga) nouns in -इ (-i) arethe most important class. नपुंसकलिङ्ग (napunsakalinga)-इ (-i) stems and स्त्रीलिङ्ग (strilinga) -3 (-u) stems are relatively rare and, therefore, their paradigms are omitted here. (See 6.2.c below.) The paradigms are: a. पुंलिङ्ग (pumlinga) -इ (-i) मुनिः (munih) sage, holy man वचन

Note: The पुंलिङ्ग (pumlinga) and स्त्रीलिङ्ग (strilinga) paradigms differ of necessity only in the instrumental singular and the accusative plural, while the feminine has alternate endings for cases 4,5,6, and 7, one of which is the same as the masculine -इ(-i) stem and the other of which is the same as the feminine - 31 (-ā) stem (see 5.1). Since the stem forms and the nomina tive singular forms are the same for both the gis (pumlinga) and FC (strilinga) forms, it is important to memorize the correct genders of such words as they are learned. There is a general, but by no means invariable, rule that words that end in-ति (-ti),-धि (-dhi) and-टि (-ti) are usually स्त्रीलिङ्ग (strilinga).

a. The -3 (-1) and the - 3 (-u) stems are exceptions to the general

rule that go (pumlinga) and This (napumsaka) nouns in the same stem final are identical except in the gem

(prathamā) and frien (dvitīyā) faut-s (vibhakti-s). b. Note that in these declensions - 5 (-i) and the -3 (-u) are

treated analogously, each remaining unchanged, being "guņated" (see 3.6-7), lengthened, or changed to the cor responding semivowel in the same cases. नपुंसक (napumsaka) -इ (-i) stems and स्त्रीलिङ्ग (strilinga)-3 (-u) stems (not illustrated here) are similarly analogous to नपुंसक (napumsaka)-3 (-u) and स्त्रीलिङ्ग (strilinga) -इ (-1) stems, respectively. Thus the films (strilinga) noun 277 (dhenu), "cow,” declines similarly to fa: (gatiḥ): : (dhenuh), (dhenü), Etha: (dhenavah), etc. The holes (napumsakalinga) noun aif (vāri), “water,” declines similarly to मधु (madhu): वारि (vari), वारिणी (varini), वारीणि (vārīņi), etc. Keep in mind that the HTH 105° (saptami eka") of the gless (pumlinga) (optionally Fils (strilinga]) stems in both -$ (-1) and -3 (-u) is -37 (-au). This often causes further confusion among already confused Sanskrit stu dents, especially since this ending is the one which marks the 4471 (prathamā) and f&citii facea (dvitiyā dvivacana) of many stems.

Examples: -5 (-i);

अग्नौ प्रक्षिपति घृतम् । agnau praksipati ghstam. (He throws the ghee in the fire.)

-3 (-u);

शत्रावपि स्निह्यति साधुः । śatrāv api snihyati sādhuḥ. (A good man loves even his enemy.)

e. In addition to the nouns that end in 5 (i) and 3 (u), there are

a number of adjectives that have their stems in 5 (i) and 3 (u). These of course must agree in gender, number and case with the noun they modify. Example: बहवः शिष्याः पुस्तकं पठन्ति । bahavaḥ śişyāḥ pustakam pathanti. (Many students read the book.)

6.3

Interrogative, relative, and correlative: The 2-4-(k-y-t) series As in English, a Sanskrit sentence may be either declarative or interrogative, while a clause of a sentence may be subor dinate or independent. a. Interrogative sentences

A sentence may be marked as interrogative in a number of ways. i. One way is by giving a declarative sentence a rising

inflection at its end similar to the inflection used for this purpose in English. This, however, cannot be rep resented in the written language. Another simple way to turn a declarative sentence into an interrogative is to make the अव्ययपद (avyayapada-indeclinable) अपि (api) the first word of the sentence. Here again a ris ing inflection is usually employed in speech. These two techniques serve to form general questions with

regard to an entire statement. Such questions can be answered either "yes" or "no." Examples: declarative: रामः सीतया सह वनं गच्छति । rāmaḥ sītayā saha vanam gacchati. (Rāma goes to the forest with Sītā.)

interrogative:

अपि रामः सीतया सह वनं गच्छति । api rāmaḥ sītayā saha vanam gacchati? (Does Rāma go to the forest with Sītā?)

ii. Another very important kind of interrogative sentence

is that in which a particular part of speech is replaced by an appropriate interrogative element. This kind of question calls for a specific answer. Examples: declarative: 274: H I HE Q Tourai rāmaḥ sītayā saha vanam gacchati. (Rāma goes to the forest with Sītā.)

interrogatives: co: HARI HE QE Toula i kaḥ sītayā saha vanam gacchati? (Who goes to the forest with Sītā?) रामः किं करोति । rāmaḥ kim karoti? (What does Rāma do?)

रामः कया सहा वनं गच्छति । rāmaḥ kayā saha vanam gacchati? (With whom does Rāma go to the forest?)

(14: $ quia i rāmaḥ kutra vasati? (Where does Rāma live?)

97

कस्त्वं कस्मादागच्छसि । kas tvam? kasmādāgacchasi. (Who are you? Where do you come from?)

All of these "question words," whether pronouns, ad

jectives, or adverbs, begin with the sound of (k). b. Subordinate Clauses

As in English, a Sanskrit clause may be either indepen dent, i.e., able to stand alone as a sentence, or subordinate, i.e., unable to stand alone. Subordinate clauses may be participial or relative. The former will be considered in connection with the various participles. The latter corre spond to English relative clauses such as:

"all who wish to leave ..." "where the sun never shines ..."

"the girl with whom you were speaking ..." Clauses of this kind in Sanskrit always include a relative marker. These are pronouns, adjectives, or adverbs corre sponding closely to the interrogative markers. These words, however, always begin with the sound (y). This distinc tion is in contrast to English where the same words are generally used both in interrogative and relative senses. Examples:

यः सीतया सह वनं गच्छति yah sītayā saha vanam gacchati... ([the man) who goes to the forest with Sītā ...)

यया सह रामो वनं गच्छति yayā saha rāmo vanam gacchati... ([the woman) with whom Rāma goes to the forest ...)

यत्र वसति रामः yatra vasati rāmaḥ... (where Rāma lives...)

Correlative Clauses Correlative clauses are independent clauses that "complete" relative clauses to form complex sentences. They are like

98

the English clauses: "All who wish to leave may go," "/ couldn't live where the sun never shines," "The girl with whom you were speaking is my sister." Notice that in the English examples only the relative clause contains a marker (in these cases a pronoun). Sanskrit usage differs from that of English in that it generally requires that the correla tive clause, too, contain a corresponding marker. Thus it is as though we were to say, "All who wish to leave they may go," “Where the sun never shines I couldn't live there," or "The girl with whom you were speaking she is my sis ter." Such correlatives are marked by a series of pronouns, adjectives, and adverbs corresponding to the interrogative and relative markers. The pronouns in this case are none other than those you have already learned as demonstra tive pronouns (5.5). With the exception of the 92410 (prathamā eka) of the foş (pumlinga) and Fit (striliñga), H (sah) and HI (sā), all these forms begin with the sound (t). Examples:

यः सीतया सह वनं गच्छति स रामः । yaḥ sītayā saha vanam gacchati sa rāmaḥ. (Rāma is the one who goes to the forest with Sītā.)

यया सह रामो वनं गच्छति सा सीता । yayā saha rāmo vanam gacchati sā sitā. (Sitā is the one with whom Rāma goes to the forest.)

यत्र वसति रामस्तत्र वसति सीता yatra vasati rāmas tatra vasati sitā. (Sitā lives where Rāma lives.)

6.4

Knowledge of this 7-a (y-t) set of markers is essential in that it enables one quickly to break up seemingly imposing sentences into simple, easily manageable units.Example: यया (कन्यया] सह वनं गच्छति दशरथस्य पुत्रस्तामहं पश्यामि । yayā (kanyayā] saha vanam gacchati daśarathasya putras tām aham paśyāmi. (I see her (the girl] with whom the son of Dasaratha is going to the forest.) In this sentence the 4-a (y-t) (relative correlative) correspon dence 71 (yayā) / 14 (tām) shows us that we have two clauses with a common referent. (For convenience we will use the most common prose word order for such clauses according to which the relative and the correlative marker each appear at the beginning of their respective clauses.) Each clause may now be read as a separate entity, each with its own syntax. Thus the independent clause is the simple sentence: DIE 434114 (tām aham paśyāmi—I see her), while the relative clause is the simple sentence: कन्यया सह वनं गच्छति रामः (vayā saha vanam gacchati rāmaḥ-Rāma goes to the forest with a girl), made relative by the substitution of the appropriate rela tive pronoun. 3Top146-s (Avyayapada-s-Indeclinables) of the 7-7-77 (k-y t) series. The 3TopyG-s (avyayapada-s-indeclinables) belonging to this series are adverbs with a variety of meanings, which are more or less closely related to the basic case system and each of which is represented by a particular ending or letter.

The meanings, corresponding case (if any), and distinctive. endings are shown in the following chart.

These endings are affixed to a syllable consisting of क् (k), य् (y), or a (t) (depending on whether an interrogative, relative, or correlative is intended) and a short vowel (which is always 31 (a), except in the case of two interrogatives which have 3 [u]). The adverbs of the series, then, are:

These series must be committed to memory as quickly as pos sible. In addition, the general meanings of the endings listed in 6.6 should be memorized, as this will make their other ap plications quite simple to grasp.

यथा त्वं जानासि तथाहं जानामि । (A) yathā tvam jānāsi, tathāham jānāmi.

(I know in the same way as you.)

(Q)

कुतः प्रणश्यति पुरुषः । kutaḥ praņaśyati puruṣaḥ. (From what does a man perish?) यतो बुद्धिर्नश्यति तत एव प्रणश्यति पुरुषः । yato buddhir naśyati, tata eva praņaśyati puruṣaḥ. (Whence the intellect is destroyed, from that very thing a man perishes.)

(When do sages go to the forest?) यदा पुत्राणां पुत्रान्पश्यन्ति तदा गृहं त्यजन्ति वनं च गच्छन्ति । yadā putrāņām putrān paśyanti, tadā grham tyajanti vanam ca gacchanti. (When they see their sons' sons, they abandon home and go to the forest.)

102

6.11

The adverbs in - (-dā) and -7 (-tra) can be repeated to indi cate a distributive sense of various times or places. Thus: यत्र यत्र रामो गच्छति तत्र तत्र सीतानुगच्छति । yatra yatra rāmo gacchati tatra tatra sītānugacchati. (To whichever places Rāma goes, there Sītā follows.)

यदा यदा हि धर्मस्य ग्लानिर्भवति भारत । अभ्युत्थानमधर्मस्य तदात्मानं सृजाम्यहम् ॥ भगवद्गीता ४७

yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata, abhyutthānam adharmasya tadātmānam sțjāmy aham. (Whenever, o Bhārata, there is a waning of righteousness and an increase of unrighteousness, then I create myself.) (Bhagavadgitā 4.7) (Memorize this verse.)

6.12

The adverbial endings given at 6.6 are not restricted to the op 4-0 (k-y-t) stems. They may also be added to a variety of other pronominal (and in a few cases nominal) stems to form adverbs with the same general meanings. This is especially so in the case of the pronominally declined adjectives listed at 5.7. Some of the more common and useful of these forms are: - 21 (-thā): 3R (anyathā) otherwise

सर्वथा (sarvathā) every which way -2: (-tah): 37 : (anyataḥ) from another source

(ekataḥ) from one side,

on the one hand सर्वतः

(sarvataḥ) from all sides -a (-da): 3PIGI (anyadā) another time

एकदा (ekada) once, one time

सर्वदा (sarvadā) always, all the time -त्र (-tra): अन्यत्र (anyatra) elsewhere

एकत्र (ekatra) in one place

(sarvatra) everywhere परत्र (paratra) in another place,

in the next world

6.15

4147 (Sarvanāman-Pronouns) of the 6-4-(k-y-t) series. The same 06-7-7 (k-y-t) correspondence exists throughout the regular pronominal system. If the third person demonstrative pronouns given in 5.5 are taken as the correlatives, then the relatives are formed simply by substituting (y) for the initial consonant (s) or a (t) of the desired form. The interrogatives are likewise formed by the substitution of a (k) for the initial, except in the case of the 2441 (prathamā) and faciem co TyHP (dvitiyā ekao napusaka), where the very common interrogative for (kim—what) is substi tuted for तत् (tat)—यत् (yat). Usage of 57-4-1 (k-y-t) Series Pronouns In order for there to be true correlation between two pronomi nal items, one relative and one correlative, they must, of course, agree in gender and in number. The gender of the person, place, thing, action, etc., is inherent. The number is depen dent upon the context. One feature of this type of compound sentence, however, is often confusing to the beginner and should be made clear at the outset. This is the fact that the case of the relative need not be the same as that of its correlative. For, unlike gender and number, case is strictly a function of a given syntactical sequence, i.e., of the relation of words in a clause. As we saw at 6.4, each clause in such a sentence is itself a syntactical unit. Consider the following sentence:

येषां राक्षसानां रावणो नृपस्तान्हन्ति रामः । yeşām rākṣasānām rāvaņo nặpas tān hanti rāmaḥ. (Rāma kills the demons whose king is Rāvana.)

Here the noun TATA (rākşasa) plays a role in both clauses. The gender is, of course, to (pumlinga). Since the context re quires many TA-s (rākṣasa-s), the number must be E° (bahu°). Regarding the cases, however, each clause must be treated individually. In the independent clause, the T&H-S (rākşasa-s) represented by the correlative pronoun are the

104

(karman-direct object) of the verbal root VT (han). There fore, the word must be in the Pacite (dvitiyā). In the relative clause, however, the shel (karty—subject) of the verbal root V376 (as) (understood), the king of the demons, is in the geht (prathamā) while the relativised demons must be put in the appropriate 481 (sasthi). Examples:

येन पुरुषेण सह भाषते नृपः स मुनिः । yena puruṣeņa saha bhāşate nạpaḥ sa munih. (The man with whom the king is speaking, (he) is a sage.)

यस्मिन्वने वसति रामस्तस्मिन्वने न विद्यन्ते राक्षसाः । yasmin vane vasati rāmas, tasmin vane na vidyante rākṣasāḥ. (In the forest where Rāma lives, (in that forest) there are no demons.)

याभ्यां सह गच्छति सीता तौ रामश्च लक्ष्मणश्च । yābhyām saha gacchati sītā, tau rāmaś ca lakṣmaṇaś ca. (The two with whom Sitā is going are Rāma and Laksmana.)

यस्यान्या गतिर्नास्ति स संस्कृतं पठति । yasyānyā gatir nāsti, sa samskstam pathati. (Who has nothing else to do, he studies Sanskrit.)

यस्मानोद्विजते लोको लोकानोद्विजते च यः स मे प्रिय इति वदति श्रीकृष्णः । yasmān nodvijate loko lokān nodvijate ca yaḥ, sa me priya iti vadati śrīkrsṇaḥ. (On account of whom the world does not tremble, and who does not tremble on account of the world, he is dear to me, so says Srīkęsņa.)

6.16

It should be clear that learning the above indeclinables and pronouns will provide you with powerful tools for generating complex sentences, especially in response to a specific question. Such questions and answers, with respect to a specific story or reading, form a major part of the traditional method of Sanskrit instruction.

105

6.17

6.18

Indefinite and Absolute Negative Constructions These same forms of the interrogative and relative adverbs and pronouns may be used in conjuction with a few simple particles to generate phrases indicating indefiniteness and absolute negativity. A very simple technique to indicate indefiniteness is to use the corresponding relative and interrogative in succession, often following the pair by the particle 319 (api). Examples: 47119 (yatra kutrāpi) somewhere or other 2 S yyria (yena kenāpy upāyena) by some means or other, by hook or by crook

The interrogative alone followed by the particles 3779 (api), a (cana), or Fac (cit) serves to indicate something not really specified. This construction often has a force similar to that of the indefinite article in English. It is especially common where the name of a person or place is not specified or not important. Examples: मह्यं किंचिद्वदति । mahyam kimcid vadati. (He tells me something.)

6.19

तत्र कश्चन ब्राह्मणो वसति । tatra kaścana brāhmaṇo vasati. (A [Some) brāhman lives there.)

कस्मिंश्चिन्नगरे वसति स्म नृपः । kasmimś cin nagare vasati sma nộpaḥ (The king lived in a (some) city.)

6.20

The addition of the negative particle 7 (na) to one of the above phrases indicates absolute exclusion or negativity. Examples: न कश्चन शृणोति माम् । na kaścana śīņoti mām. (Nobody listens to me.)

106

न कयापि कन्यया सह संवदति । na kayāpi kanyayā saha samvadati. (He is not speaking with any girl.)

न मे नश्यति किंचन । na me naśyati kimcana. (Nothing of mine is destroyed.)

6.21

Negation Negation in Sanskrit is basically of two kinds. These may be called propositional negation, whereby a verbal phrase is negated, and term negation, whereby a nominal item alone is negated. In propositional negation the negative particle 7 (na) (or 1 [mā); see 11.18) is inserted into the clause, normally before the finite verb if it is expressed. Examples: रामो वनं न गच्छति । rāmo vanam na gacchati. (Rāma doesn't go to the forest.)

नाहं ब्राह्मणः । nāham brāhmaṇaḥ. (I am not a brāhman.)

In term negation, a nominal item alone may be negated by the prefixation of the syllable 37 (a), similar in meaning to English un-, in-, non-, im-, etc. If the item begins with a vowel, the prefix is 37 (an). Examples: तदसमीचीनं भवति । tad asamicīnam bhavati. (That is not good.)

अनार्याः कुत्र वसन्ति । anāryāḥ kutra vasanti? (Where do non-āryans live?)
