8.0

8.1

All the noun stems introduced thus far have ended in vowels. This is not the case, however, with all nouns. Several classes of nouns have stems with consonant finals. These stems (and some vowel stems—see below, 10.0), unlike the nouns so far learned, have a distinction of stem strength. Noun Stem Strength a. Of पुंलिङ्ग and स्त्रीलिङ्ग stems, the only strong forms are प्रथमा

Pahit, 2004, ferea, and bea; and the reciten fant, एकवचन, and द्विवचन. The rest are weaker. Some stems further distinguish, among the weaker forms, a weak and a weakest, depending upon whether the inflectional ending

begins with a consonant (weak) or a vowel (weakest). b. Of नपुंसकलिङ्ग stems, only the प्रथमा and द्वितीया बहुवचन are

strong. If the stem distinguishes degree of weakness, the प्रथमा and द्वितीया एकवचन are weak while the same cases of the face are the weakest. Other cases are, as usual, the

same as the corresponding is stems. Noun Stems in -37 (-an)

An important class of consonant stems ends in -367 (-an). These stems are all पुंलिङ्ग or नपुंसकलिङ्ग. Try to learn these nouns in both stem and nominative singular form. If only the first is leamed, you will not know the gender; if only the second, you are apt to forget the stem ending and confuse the nouns with those of the -31 (-a) or -371 (-a) classes. Strength in-341 (-an) Stems The strong forms show the last vowel of the stem as - 31 (-ā), the weak as - 31 (-a), and the weakest as Ø (i.e., the vowel is lost). The difference in the degree of the strong-weak distinc

tion has to do with the place of accentual strength at an earlier stage of the language. This also accounts for the strength in the present system. This type of accentuation is absent in clas sical Sanskrit, although its effects are clearly seen. In dealing with this class of nouns, it is wise to learn the paradigms of the important items thoroughly. As an aid to memory, however, keep in mind a short sentence incorporating the instrumental singular form of each item. This case shows the weakest form if there is one. For practical purposes keep in mind that stems whose second consonant is part of a conjunct (e.g., 3114427 (ātman), ci [karman]) show the strong/weak alternation while others (e.g., T5F! [rājan), 147] [nāman]) show the strong/weak/ weakest alternation. Examples:

राज्ञा विना राज्यं नश्यति । rājñā vinā rājyam naśyati. (Without a king, the kingdom perishes.)

कर्मणा विना न कश्चन जीवति । karmaņā vinā na kaścana jīvati. (Nobody lives without karma.)

आत्मनात्मानं जानाति पण्डितः । ātmanātmānam jānāti panditaḥ (The wise man knows the Self by means of the Self.)

अयोध्यायां राजा वर्तते दशरथो नाम्ना । ayodhyāyām rājā vartate daśaratho nāmnā. (There is a king in Ayodhyā, Dasaratha by name.)

8.4

Typical Case Endings Note the case endings of these nouns. Although these and other stems are statistically outnumbered by the -31 (-a) and - 371 (-ā) classes, these endings are really the typical" ones for each case. This is especially important to note in the social139

weak cases. The proper endings then, for consonant and many vowel stems are: तृतीया_आ चतुर्थी—ए पञ्चमी—अः षष्ठी-अः सप्तमी—इ Memorize these endings as quickly as possible.

अनघ

(Anadyatanabhūte Lan); The Imperfect This is one of the several verbal (and nominal-verbal) forms used to indicate preterite or "past" time in Sanskrit. All of these forms are best translated as “simple past" tenses in En glish. Keep clearly in mind that terms like "imperfect" have been given by Western grammarians as classifiers on the basis of parallels with grammars of classical languages. They do not indicate anything with regard to the "aspect" or degree of duration or repetition of the action or state suggested by a ver bal root. Even the Sanskrit name 3AERAYA (past time prior to today) serves now only as a classifier. The form is by no means actually restricted in its application as the name would sug gest. The 5 is formed mechanically from the present stems of the previous lesson. Once these are learned, the 35 is quite simple and so has the virtue of greatly expanding your ability to use the language with a minimum of new memorization. Formation of the लङ् The 5 is formed from the appropriate present stems by two simple steps: 1. A preterite augment: the syllable 37 (a) is prefixed to the

stem. This augment, or 31714 (āgama), which is used with some other past tenses, is peculiar phonologically in that it combines with root initial vowels to form the art of the initial instead of the expected (3.7) M. Example:

8.7

8.8

Vi (2P) (go)

+ 3 a (augment)+ i (weak stem) → ai (weak stem of 5)

2. To the appropriate stems (strong or weak as at 7.10.1)

are directly suffixed the appropriate "secondary" endings.

143

8.9

The Secondary Endings for the लङ् (lan) are:

प्रथम

एक

त् -t स्

परस्मैपद

आत्मनेपद द्वि बहु | एक द्वि बहु ताम् अन् / उः | त आताम् अन्त / अत / रन् -tam -an/uh | -ta -atam -anta/ata/ran

तम्

थाः आथाम् ध्वम् -tam

-thah -atham -dhvam व म । इ/ए वहि महि -va __-ma | -i/e -vahi -mahi

मध्यम

उत्तम

अम् -am

8.10

It is evident that they are often closely related to the "primary" endings but are shorter or lighter. The उत्तम° एक° आतत्मनेपद ending 5 (i) regularly combines with the 31 (a) of a preceding गण sign to form ए (e). "अ" गण-s For the "a" गण-s the situation is quite simple and regular. Root प्रथम एक लट् प्रथम एक लङ् Meaning भू भवति

अभवत् Vbhū bhavati abhavat he was

अगच्छत agacchat

he went

गम् गच्छति Vgam gacchati

मन् मन्यते Vman manyate

अमन्यत

amanyata

he thought

कुप् Vkup

कुप्यति kupyati

अकुप्यत् akupyat

he was angry

Rules for adding the terminations are the same as those given at 4.22 above. The प्रथम बहु परस्मैपद takes the ending -अन् (-an). The प्रथम बहु आत्मनेपद takes the ending -अन्त (-anta).

144

Before these endings, and before the 3714°° RH4 ending -37 (-am), the 37 (a) of the Tu signs is lost. 371/7837 (agacchan) they went 31467 (abhavan) they were 31964 (avadam) I said 374PIR (amanyanta) they thought

8.11

"Non-3710-(gana-s) The "non-37" Tu-s are also generally regular, but there are a few points that require mention. a. The third, 5,- takes the ending 3: (uh) in 979°E 4 6. Before this ending the final vowel of the stem is subject to

. Examples: हु अजुहोत्

अजुहुताम् Vhu → ajuhot (he offered), ajuhutām (those two offered),

अजुहवुः but ajuhavuḥ (they offered).

b.

The seventh, 54, is quite regular, but note that the प्रथम° and मध्यम° of the strong forms present what appear to be anomalous endings because of the fact that their stem final consonants form, with the single consonants of the endings, conjuncts that must be resolved (see 3.25.f) by the loss of what are, here, the actual endings. Examples: Fl (Vbhuj-eat) (7P)

प्रथम

मध्यम (374 ) ► 374757 (377) → 37776 (abhunakt) → abhunak (abhunaks) → abhunak

The important root 376 (be) inserts the vowel $ (1) be tween the stem and the endings a (t) and (s) of the 5 yielding 3 ht: (āsiņ—you were) and the enormously com mon narrative tal (āsit—he, she, it was; or there was).

145

Example: आसीद्राजा दशरथो नाम । राज्ञो राज्ये बहवो मुनय आसन् । āsīd rājā daśaratho nāma. rājño rājye bahavo munaya āsan. (There was a king by the name of Dasaratha. There were many sages in the king's realm.)

8.12

8.13

3440f-s (Upasarga-s): Verbal Prefixes 341-s, or verbal prefixes, are one of a number of factors ac counting for the flexibility and richness of Sanskrit. The use of these simple, easily memorized prefixes greatly enhances the connotative power of the various verbal roots without any thing like the mental effort that would be required to memorize wholly different verbs for each meaning.

The 3441-s function basically in three ways, although these func tions frequently overlap and are not consistent for all 3421-s or even for the same one with different roots. Wemay classify their function as: a. pleonastic: This is the case in which the prefixation of an

34701 does not substantially alter the basic meaning of a verbal root. Example: 34 +374 → 345978 = a upa + Vlabh (1Ā) (obtain) → upalabhate = labhate (gain, obtain, acquire)

analytic: Here the 34481 has a particular semantic value of its own, by which it modifies or qualifies the meaning of a verbal root. Example:

अव +तु → अवतरति ava (down) + VtỊ (1P) (cross) → avatarati (he descends)

c. idiomatic: Here the combination of an 341 and a root

yields a meaning not clearly related to either.

146

Examples: 319 + 374 → 34tofa ava (down) + Vgam (1P) (go) → avagacchati (he understands)

अनु + ज्ञा → अनुजानाति anu (after) + Vjñā (9P) (know) ► anujānāti (he permits)

8.14

In any given case, the same combination of 34671 and verbal root may be used in any of these three ways. The context and usage must always be considered. Examples: 379 +374 → 37 tofa ava (down) + Vgam (go) → avagacchati—(a) he understands; (b) he goes down

34 + 4 → 34947 upa + Vlabh (obtain) → upalabhate-(a) he obtains; (b) he leams, knows

It should be kept in mind that the above examples are by no means intended to be exhaustive of the uses of the उपसर्ग-s. Rather they are to suggest some of the common applications of these important prefixes.

There is no restriction as to the number of 34ri-s that may precede a given verbal form or its derivatives. Two and sometimes three may be strung together before a root to give some additional shade of meaning.

Examples: उद् + आ + ह → उदाहरति ud + a + Vhr (1P) → udāharati (he gives an illustration)

सम् + आ + गम् → समागच्छन्ति sam + ā + Vgam (1P) → samāgacchanti (they convene)

अभि + उप + आ + इ → अभ्युपैति abhi + upa +ā + Vi (2P) → abhyupaiti (he approaches, agrees)

8.18

Placement of उपसर्ग-s (upasarga-s) An उपसर्ग or series of उपसर्ग-s is placed immediately before the verbal form that it modifies. However, in the case of preterite tenses such as the 35, which require the preterite augment (आगम), it is the augment that immediately precedes the verbal stem, while the उपसर्ग-s, if any, must precede the augment.

Examples:

लट उप + विश्

उपविशति

उपाविशत् upa + vvis (6P) (sit) | upavisati (he sits) | upāvisat (he sat)

लङ्

नि + वस् ni + vvas (1P)

निवसति nivasati

(he inhabits)

न्यवसत् nyavasat

अभि + उप +इ

अभ्युपेमः abhi + upa + Vi (2P) | abhyupemah

(agree)

अभ्युपैम abhyupaima

A. B.

Translate the reading into English. Rewrite the reading, changing all the Mc forms into their corresponding 5 forms, and all the 5 forms into their corresponding Se forms. Translate the following sentences into Sanskrit: 1. When Rāma came for Sītā's Face (svayamvara), all the

kings ridiculed him. 2. None of the kings (lit., no king at all) lifted Siva's bow. 3. The sages did not understand what you said. (Put relative

clause first.) 4. Janaka stood up in the assembly (At-sabhā) of the kings

and said, “Rāma has won.” (Use çfa (iti]). 5. Finally the proud king became very angry (4 Vkrudh). 6. But the hero did not exert himself and did not break the

bow. 7. The proud queen forgot the name of the angry sage. 8. "O, Sambhu! You promised me a kingdom!” he said. 9. That woman never forgot her for (svayamvara). 10. The king's son, by name Devadatta, reviled Sambhu. 11. A fool does not easily obtain the Self. 12. "Why did he eat grass?" they thought. Memorize the following verse.

केयूरा न विभूषयन्ति पुरुषं हारा न चन्द्रोज्ज्वला

न स्नानं न विलेपनं न कुसुमं नालंकृता मूर्धजाः । वाण्येका समलंकरोति पुरुषं या संस्कृता धार्यते

क्षीयन्ते खलु भूषणानि सततं वाग्भूषणं भूषणम् ।।

Bracelets do not adorn a person, nor necklaces shining like the moon, not baths and ointments, flowers or jewelled coiffures. Only that speech which is refined (samsksta) adorns a person. Mere omaments will always fade; the ornament of speech is the only true ornament.
