11 Stems in -अन्त; Adjectival Suffixes in-मन्त् and -वन्तः The क्तवतु (Past Active Participle); The त्वान्त, ल्यबन्त (Gerund); The लोट् (Imperative)


11.0

11.1

Stems in -376 There are a number of nominal and adjectival stems in Sanskrit that end in the vowel 37 followed by the conjunct - These words fall into a very few fairly significant categories.

1. Adjectives formed with the possessive suffixes -Hal and

-वन्त् (traditionally called मतुप् and वतुप respectively by the

grammarians). 2. The वर्तमाने कृदन्त (present participle). See Lesson 15. 3. A small number of anomalous forms which appear to have

belonged originally to 1 or 2. The following paradigms are for stems belonging to 1 and 3 above. The present participles (2), whose paradigm differs slightly, will be treated separately (Lesson 15).. a. पुंलिङ्ग । भगवन्त् (blessed) एक०

बहु भगवान् भगवन्तौ भगवन्तः भगवन्तम् भगवन्तौ भगवतः भगवता भगवट्याम् भगवद्भिः भगवते भगवद्भ्याम् भगवद्यः भगवतः

भगवद्याम्

भगवद्भ्यः भगवतः भगवतोः

भगवताम् भगवति भगवतोः भगवत्सु सम् भगवन् भगवन्तौ भगवन्तः

192

b. As usual, the नपुंसकलिङ्ग differs from the पुंलिङ्ग only in the

प्रथमा and द्वितीया. नपुंसकलिङ्ग । भगवन्त (blessed)

बहु भगवत् भगवती भगवन्ति

भगवत् भगवती भगवन्ति सम्° भगवत् भगवती भगवन्ति

एक

Note that stem strength and weakness is shown by the pres ence or absence of the stem nasal 7 (see 8.1). The Fill, or feminine, of the stems is formed by adding ई to the weak stem (-अत्) and is then declined like any noun of that stem final (see 7.1). Example: भगवती (blessed lady)

11.2

There are two stems that end in -अन्त् ,which are very useful and should be learned. a. The important adjective 46 (large, great) is declined like

the above, but its stem vowel 37 is long (371) in all the strong forms. Examples: महानृषिर्दृश्यते न दृश्यते वा कलौ युगे । (Does a great rsi appear or not in the kali age?)

राक्षसा महान्तौ वीरौ न कदापि घ्नन्ति ।

(The rāksasa-s never kill the two great heroes.) b. The word भवन्त् (स्त्रीलिङ्ग–भवती), perhaps a shortened form

ofभगवन्त,is regularly used as a polite or respectfulequiva lent of the 4434449 pronoun. It construes with the verb in the प्रथमपुरुष and may be used in the बहुवचन to show still

greater respect Examples: भवान्कस्माद् देशादागतवान् । (From what country have you come?) (See 11.4)

193

भवन्तः कुत्र वसन्ति । (Where do you live?)

यद्भवत्या कृतं तन्मह्यमतीव रोचते । (What you (my lady) have done pleases me very much.)

तत्कथं ज्ञातं भवद्भिः । (How do you know this?)

11.3

The Adjectival Suffixes - and del The most common forms of this type are adjectives made by suffixation of the possessive affix -मन्त् (मतुप) to the stem form of most nouns. Examples:

(intelligence) बुद्धिमन्त् (wise) Hla: (f) (memory, sacred स्मृतिमन्त् (possessed of

knowledge)

memory) T: (n) (bow)

44* (having a bow) (m)

(archer) 48 (n) (honey)

मधुमन्त् (sweet) रामो बुद्धिमान्स्मृतिमानित्युक्तं रामायणे । (It is said in the Rāmāyana that Rāma is wise and possessed of memory.)

The suffix-R is changed to or when: 1. The stem ends in a 4 or an 31 or 311, or if any one of the

proceeding occurs as the penultimate. Examples: faen (f) (knowledge) felldar (possessed of knowledge) Get (f) (fortune) FHCR (possessed of fortune)

RIE (n) (fame) यशस्वन्त् (famous) 2. The stem originally ends in a 42.

Example: TEC (n) (lightning) विधुत्वन्त् (possessed of lightning)

194

NOTE: The stem to which the - Alor -suffix is added is not considered word final. Therefore, the addition of these affixes do not require external सन्धि . The 2699 (Past Active Participle) Such possessive usages are fairly limited. However, the suf fixation of ont (fieradi) to a T or, whether its verbal root is सकर्मक or अकर्मक, yields a useful and common verbal adjective modifying the day, which functions as yet another simple past tense in the air reti. Examples: V774 (go) I 74 Than I Hang Traditi (Rāma went to the forest. Sītā went too.)

VH8 (10P) (eat); vaq (2P) (say) नाहं भक्षितवानम्बेत्युक्तवाञ्छीकृष्णो भागवते । (“I didn't eat [it] mummy," so said Srikssna in the Bhāgavata Purāņa.)

11.5

The त्वान्त/ल्यबन्त (Gerund) The gerund, or indeclinable participle in-call or -7, is one of the most frequently encountered and useful items in the lan guage. The gerund is used, often profusely, to mark successive dependent clauses, the actions of which are meant to be prior to, or, in some cases, simultaneous with, the action of an inde pendent clause. In most cases the of the dependent clause is the same as that of the independent clause. In this way, a complex sentence may have only one finite verb or its syntac tic equivalent Examples: पौत्रान्दृष्ट्वा कुटुम्बं परित्यज्य वनं गत्वा वृक्षस्य समीप उपविश्येन्द्रियाणि विजित्य परमं ध्यात्वा च मोक्षं लभते मनुष्यः । (Having seen his grandchildren, having left his family, having gone to the forest, having sat down near a tree, having sub dued his senses, and having meditated on the highest, a man obtains liberation.)

195

कपेस्तद्वचनं श्रुत्वा सीता सुखिताभवत् । (Having heard the monkey's speech, Sītā became happy.)

उक्त्वा भुक्त्वा गता गृहम् । (Having talked and eaten, she went home.)

11.6

Since itis always an अव्ययपद (indeclinable) the त्वान्त or ल्यबन्त is not subject to agreement of any kind with कर्तृ ,कर्मन् , or any thing else. Because of this it may be used freely in both sidik and if clauses with reference generally to the tree regard less of its case. Example: रामेण तत्र गत्वा सर्वे राक्षसा हताः । (Rāma, having gone there, killed all the rākṣasa-s.)

11.7

The CalR/Cyant is formed in different ways, depending upon whether the verbal root is preceded by an 3441-1. (See 8.12.) a. i. If there is no 34771, the suffix -rall is added directly to a

weak form of the root, in general the same form which precedes the - of the Ye EGR. (See 10.7-9.) These forms are called Calle Examples: Vory (12)

Taal (having gone) VE (2) ► Oral (having slain) VET (4P)

(having seen) Vol (SP)

al (having heard) Vवच् (2P) 3964| (having said) Vत्यज् (1P)

त्यक्त्वा (having abandoned) (8P)

al (having done) स्था (1P) स्थित्वा (having stood) 191 (1P)

tical (having drunk) (3P)

Grall (having given) (3P)

focal (having placed)

voce

VET

196

ii. A number of roots require the insertion of the vowel 3

before the ending. Others take the vowel optionally. The root VTE (9P) (Talla) requires the vowel $ (cf. 10.9-11). Examples: Van (1P) → 379cal (having dwelt) viac (2) fleral (having known) VJE (9P) → Tetrall (having taken)

iii. Roots of the tenth 1 (7.38) require that the ending

-roll, which must be preceded by the vowel 5, replace the final 37 of the present stem. Example: VaR (10P)Parafical (having thought)

b. Roots preceded by 34421-s form the gerund in two ways,

depending upon whether or not the root ends in a short vowel. These forms are called S R . i. If the root does not end in a short vowel (by far the

most common case), the car is formed by adding the suffix - directly to the root. Before this suffix (and the suffix -27; see ii below) the roots generally take the weakened forms appropriate before the -of the भूते कृगन्त. (See 10.7-9.) Examples: परि + Vत्य

परित्यज्य (having abandoned) 311 + Von → 311154 (having come) 37+ VET

315k (having permitted)

ii. If a root ends in a short vowel and is preceded by an

उपसर्ग the suffix is -त्य. Examples: fa + VFG

विजित्य (having abandoned) 37] + Vēs

अनुकृत्य (having imitated) 9 + V5

प्रेत्य (having died)

Î Î

197

11.8

Note that some roots in -अम् or -अन् that form weakened past भूते कृदन्त-s (गम् → गत; हन् → हत) (see 10.7.c) are sometimes treated as short अ stems after उपसर्ग-s. So, आ + गम् may form

आगम्य or आगत्य (having come), while नि + हन् always forms निहत्य (having killed).

11.9

The लोट् (Imperative) The Ic is the mode of instruction or command. Since it oc curs most commonly in direct address, मध्यम पुरुष forms are the most frequently used, although for various reasons, includ ing politeness, theप्रथम पुरुष forms are also quite common. The TC has no mode-sign of its own and simply adds its own distinctive endings to the present stems of the various roots. The scheme of personal endings is as follows:

11.10

11.11

परस्मैपद एक द्वि प्र° तु ताम् म० ०/धि/हि तम् उ० आनि आव

बहु | एक अन्तु/अतु | ताम् त |स्व

आत्मनेपद द्वि० बहु

आताम् अन्ताम/अताम् आथाम् ध्वम् आवहै आमहै

आम

11.12 मध्यम पुरुष Endings:

a. The मध्यम एक परस्मैपद ending for roots of the 'अ' गण-s

(1,4,6,10) is 0 (zero). In other words, this most important लोट् form, is identical with the present stem. Examples: Vभू (1P) (be) हे शकुन्तले भर्तुर्बहुमता भव । (o Sakuntala, be well respected by your husband!)

स्था (1P) (stay); Vगम् (1P) (go) राम नगरे मा तिष्ठ वनमेव गच्छ । (Rama! Don't stay in the city, go to the forest.)

198

4R + Vas (1P) (wander) वने परिव्रजेति श्रुत्वा परिवाजको भवत् । (Having heard, "wander in the forest," he became a wan dering mendicant.)

145 (1P) (worship) भज गोविन्दं भज गोविन्दं गोविन्दं भज मूढमते । (Worship Govinda (Krsna), Worship Govinda, Worship Govinda, O you fool!)

b.

The non-37 10-8 (2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9) have, for this form, the endings -TE or 199, depending upon whether the verbal stem ends in a vowel or a consonant. Note that this particular form is unusual in that for the non-37 791-s it is made from the weak form of the stem, even in those 1-s that require root strength in all other 550 REY forms. Examples:

लोट V5 (2) fa spa (go!) VGE (2) alfa Ti GA 94 (Milk the cow for milk!) va (2) Taifa

(Speak! Speak, friend!)

लट्

c. Some roots of the third ( 1 present irregularities.

i. The root va itself violates rule b., in that it takes the

ending-, despite the fact that its stem ends in a vowel. Example:

E offer!)

ii. Far more important are the two common roots Val and

VET. Here they form SR (give) and ul (place). Example:

HSR GRETA (Give (me) food, O King!) d. Since all roots of the seventh (D end in consonants

and the 101 sign precedes the final consonant, all the present199

stems of the 14 likewise end in consonants. Therefore, the मध्यम° एक परस्मैपद ending in the लोट् of roots of this

गण is always -धि. Example: Vyslu, "yoke!"

e.

Roots of the fifth and eighth ( and - 1-s take the ending - when the root itself ends in a consonant. Example: V3114 I 89415 (Attain happiness!)

But, when the roots end in vowels, this form is identi cal with the weak stem itself. Examples: Vops (8P) affiti degno dia (Do what your father says, my dear boy!)

VI (5P) Tidad 1 (Hear the words of the guru.) 9th | roots ending in vowels take -TE, but those ending in consonants lose their class sign and take the special end ing -316. Example: VTE I JEMY "take"

11.13 The मध्यम° एक° आत्मनेपद is formed by adding the ending -स्व

to the present stem in all cases. Examples: VIY (47) Jezai (fight!) V24 (1Ā) 4469 Hi Gai (Forgive me, O God.)

3114 (2Ā) 3140 I (sit!)

11.14

After 4274° 55° forms, the most important are the gero 550 a. The E14 adds - to present stems. The non-37 701-

show normal strength.

200

Examples:

गम् । रामो वनं गच्छतु । (Let Rāma go to the forest.)

कृ। भरतो राज्यं करोतु । (Let Bharata rule the kingdom.)

b. This form is very frequently used, especially in dramas as

a polite or respectful equivalent of the 924°. Examples:

जि (1P) जयत्वार्यः । (May my lord [i.e., "you"] be victorious.)

प्र + /विश् प्रविशत्वार्यः ।

(Please enter, my lord.)

c. This form of the roots Vअस् (2P) (be), and Vभू (1P) (be)

(अस्तु, भवतु) is often used in the senses, "Okay.," "very well," "Let it be," etc.

11.15

The प्रथम , बहु', परस्मैपद ending -अन्तु behaves exactly like the indicative ending -31 in that it causes the loss of the -37 of an अ गण stem and loses its nasal after stems of the third गण. (See 7.25.) Examples:

पश् (4P) सर्वे भद्राणि पश्यन्तु । (May everyone see auspicious things.)

Vतृ (1P) सर्वे दुर्गाणि तरन्तु । (May everyone overcome difficulties.)

Vदा (3P) ब्राह्मणेभ्यो धनं ददतु । (Let them give wealth to the brāhmans.)

Vभी (3P) न कस्मादपि बिभ्यतु । (Let them fear nothing at all.)

201

11.16 The कर्मणि प्रयोग of the लोट् :

The लोट् may be used in the कर्मणि and भावे प्रयोग-s as well as in the कर्तरि प्रयोग. It is formed, like the कर्मणि प्रयोग of the लट् , by the addition of the appropriate आत्मनेपद लोट् ending to the कर्मणि

stem. (See 9.24-27.) 11.17 This form functions as a very formal or polite imperative and

is very freely used in conversation. In actual use, the तृतीया here usually त्वया, भवता, or भवद्भिः, “byyou") is gener ally unexpressed, and the 47 (in the 74111) is frequently (necessarily in the H RT) (see 9.17) not made explicit. Examples: Va (2P) 3724114

Lit.,"Let it be spoken (by you)."

"Please speak."

Viesca (6P) foscoually

Lit., "Let it be written (by you)."

"Please write (it)."

V3114 (2Ā) 31144214

Lit., “Let it be sat (by you).”

"Please sit down.”

31V-TA (1P) 42 HER PATH

Lit., “Let it be come (by you)

with me.” = “Please come with me.”

अलंकृ (8P) आसनम् अलंक्रियताम् Lit.,"Let the seat be adorned (by

you).”=“Please sit down.”

V&H (1Ā) Rani 959: Lit., “Let this person be

pardoned." ="Pardon me." (For 3144, see 19.1)

11.18 Note that the negative particle 41 is used instead of 7 to negate

लोट forms. Examples:

PRI TEBI (Don't go to the city.) dhe i (Don't do that.)

Translate the reading into English and be prepared to answer questions about it Sanskrit. Rewrite all the gerunds in the reading, removing 34421-s from those that have them and adding the 346f 37 to those that have none. (Don't worry about the meaning of the forms thus generated.) Translate the following sentences into Sanskrit. 1. Having entered the house and having sat on the ground, he

said to me, "Give me some food!" Upon hearing the words, “Mother, having left home, I am going to the forest,” Kausalyā said, “Let it not be!" (Use

3. Ah! Rāma, I am oppressed by great sorrow. Do not go,

having left me! My daughter is extremely intelligent and well-versed in the Fila-s. (Use - 4 suffix.) Therefore let her be the

wife of the king. 5. Stand up, you old fool! Does a man sit when the king

enters? (Use 3114 as question marker.) Transform the t clauses or sentences in "A" and "C" above into कर्मणि or भावे प्रयोग forms.
