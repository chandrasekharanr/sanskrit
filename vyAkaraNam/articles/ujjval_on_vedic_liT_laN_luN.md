## Terminology
Aorist: लुङ्, imperfect: लङ्, perfect: लिट्

As a side note, the terms "perfect", "imperfect" and "aorist" are used in Sanskrit studies because of the correspondence of the verb forms with Greek forms, but should not be confused with the actual meaning of these in general linguistics out of Sanskrit.

## Aspect vs Tense
The Vedic aorist, imperfect (with present) and perfect only mark the aspect (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tense%E2%80%93aspect%E2%80%93mood) and not the tense. (The tense is marked by the augment 'a' before verb forms and even that can be detached if its implied through other means, like the co-occurrence of other past form(s). +++(Perfect??)+++) 

If we view them like this, its no surprise +++(how??)+++ that they may occur together in a sentence. Whitney gives some examples to show their equivalence but uses temporality as the concept, and thus misses the point.

## Aortist and imperfect
The sense of the Vedic aorist is well preserved (action that has happened, also expressed by क्त).

Imperfect was used for repetitive or continuing actions (happening in the past) but in classical Sanskrit is also employed somewhat in the Vedic aorist sense.

## Perfect
Perfect was used for describing state (either in past or present). Thus वेद meant "knows" or "used to know". But in classical Sanskrit, it is used solely for narrative purpose, actions in a distant past, whether continuous (Vedic imperfect sense) or describing event (Vedic aorist sense) or state (Vedic perfect sense).

By "describing state" I mean that the verb form is only interested in telling you the final state at the time of saying. This is different from the Vedic aorist form (which has the real perfective aspect) which tells that an event has happened. Thus इन्द्रश् चकार means Indra did it, of course, and (importantly) it remains the way he intended, with little reference to when he did it. रुरुचे means shines (has the state of being shiny). Note that this doesn't at all have the perfective aspect (that denoted by the Vedic aorist).

This understanding hasn't yet failed me while reading the Rigveda (mostly the older books). It would be great if you can point to a counter-example if you know of one.
