Aorist: लुङ्, imperfect: लङ्, perfect: लिट्

The sense of the Vedic aorist is well preserved (action that has happened, also expressed by क्त).  

Imperfect was used for repetitive or continuing actions (happening in the past) but in classical Sanskrit is also employed somewhat in the Vedic aorist sense.  

Perfect was used for describing state (either in past or present). Thus वेद meant "knows" or "used to know". But in classical Sanskrit, it is used solely for narrative purpose, actions in a distant past, whether continuous (Vedic imperfect sense) or describing event (Vedic aorist sense) or state (Vedic perfect sense).
