Aorist: लुङ्, imperfect: लङ्, perfect: लिट्

As a side note, the terms "perfect", "imperfect" and "aorist" are used in Sanskrit studies because of the correspondence of the verb forms with Greek forms, but should not be confused with the actual meaning of these in general linguistics out of Sanskrit.

The sense of the Vedic aorist is well preserved (action that has happened, also expressed by क्त).  

Imperfect was used for repetitive or continuing actions (happening in the past) but in classical Sanskrit is also employed somewhat in the Vedic aorist sense.  

Perfect was used for describing state (either in past or present). Thus वेद meant "knows" or "used to know". But in classical Sanskrit, it is used solely for narrative purpose, actions in a distant past, whether continuous (Vedic imperfect sense) or describing event (Vedic aorist sense) or state (Vedic perfect sense).
