## प्रयोजनम्
- To further one's understanding (and mastery) of sanskrit language
- To understand the amazing Indian vyAkaraNa tradition. (Earliest formal grammar, it's derivations on par with Euclid's proofs). It would be hard to believe that the ancients were capable of such organized almost-algorithmic thought otherwise.
