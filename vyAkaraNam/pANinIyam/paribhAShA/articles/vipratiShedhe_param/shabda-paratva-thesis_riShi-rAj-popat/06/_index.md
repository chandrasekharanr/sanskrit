Chapter Six 

In this concluding chapter, I will discuss the thought process that might have led Pāṇini to  construct his algorithm for dealing with Same Step Rule Interaction (henceforth SSRI), how  this algorithm was interpreted by traditional and modern scholars, and finally how we can use  the knowledge of the correct meaning of 1.4.2 to conduct further research in Pāṇinian studies  and allied disciplines. In essence, I will examine the past, present and future of Pāṇinian  studies, with a special focus on the role played by SSRI in the functioning of the Pāṇinian  machine. Since the goal of this chapter is merely to summarize the timeline of Pāṇinian  thought, I will keep my arguments brief and will focus on the bigger picture, delving only  into those details that are of immediate relevance.
