title = "E: Some Thoughts on the Siddha Principle"

+++

Let us begin by looking at the fundamental justification given by Joshi and Kiparsky (1979)  for their siddha principle and will present my ideas on the same. In ‘The Ordering of Rules in  Pāṇini’s Grammar’ (1982), Kiparsky gives a detailed explanation of the siddha principle. I will  quote from this paper here. 

Kiparsky proposes the siddha principle on the basis of a vārttika on 6.1.86 ṣatvatukor asiddhaḥ ‘a single replacement in place of the preceding and the following sound segments is suspended1 with respect to any potential replacement with ṣ or insertion of augment tUK’. Kiparsky explains: “Kātyāyana says that making a rule asiddha has two functions: (ṣatvatukor)2 asiddhavacanam ādeśalakṣaṇapratiṣedhārtham utsargalakṣaṇabhāvārthaṁ ca (6.1.86, vt. 1).  

Utsarga here means sthānin, the element which undergoes substitution in a rule.”3 

I translate this vārttika as follows: ‘the statement that ṣ [replacing s] and [the insertion of the  augment] tUK are asiddha [has been made] for the purpose of preventing the operations that  are due for application to the substitute, and facilitating the operations that are due for  application to the substituendum (original item)’. 

Kiparsky then says: “to use terms common in linguistics, asiddhatva blocks bleeding and  feeding between rules.” Before going further, let us understand what he means by feeding and  bleeding: A feeds B if the application of A facilitates the application of B, and P bleeds Q if  the application of P obstructs the application of Q. 

Kiparsky concludes: “it can be said that asiddha and the other devices are restrictions (niyamas)  on a general paribhāṣā that determines how rules interact when no special statement about their  ordering is made in the grammar. This paribhāṣā is not stated in the grammar itself but it is  presupposed by the correct operation of rules in it and implied by the various restrictions on it  that are stated in the grammar. It is to be formulated as ‘sarvatra siddham’ and we refer to it  as the siddha principle.”4 He continues: “[W]hat the siddha principle says is that in the general  case we have ādeśalakṣaṇabhāva and utsargalakṣaṇapratiṣedha…in short, the siddha relations  

1 When A is suspended with respect to B, B cannot acknowledge A. 

2 The vārttika (Mbh III.65.9) has the word ṣatvatukor in it, but when Kiparsky quotes the vārttika, he  excludes this word from it.

of bleeding and feeding are given free by the underlying theory of the Aṣṭādhyāyī and if we  must not have them in some particular case, then only something must be said in the grammar  itself.”5 

Further, he says, “As far as feeding is concerned, this really goes without saying. In almost any  derivation, the application of one rule creates scope for another rule to apply, that rule applies  creating scope for a third rule and so on. That all rules in such a chain of rules are to be applied  is taken for granted in the tradition.”6 He adds, “By this point anyone familiar with the topic  will already have recognized that the principle of bleeding order is simply equivalent to the  nitya-principle in the traditional inventory of the paribhāṣās.”7 

Thus, we can say feeding and bleeding together are simply equivalent to nityatva in the  Pāṇinian tradition. And the siddha principle, which means the maximization of feeding and  bleeding, is tantamount to the maximization, wherever possible, of the use of nityatva for rule  conflict resolution, that is, in all cases involving unidirectional blocking.

Now, using diagrams, I will explain why I think Joshi and Kiparsky have made a logical error  in interpreting the aforementioned vārttika. I will focus on bleeding and not on feeding, because  as Kiparsky himself says, what he calls ‘feeding’ is built into the Pāṇinian system, and there is  no controversy about it. 

What Kātyāyana’s vārttika implies: 

A  

(asiddha = does not allow  

any recognition of the  

  

suspended i.e., asiddha 

rules and as a result 

bleeding can never take  

place 

A’ 

(siddha = allows  

recognition of all rules  and as a result bleeding  can potentially take  place. It may or may not  take place) 

Kiparsky takes the liberty to interpret this as:   

A  

(asiddha = bleeding 

never takes place) 

A’  

(siddha = bleeding always takes  

place)

240Let us use an analogy to understand this, just like Patañjali often does. Imagine that a young  boy, who is obedient to his parents, can be given one of two possible instructions by his parents  about going near the fire: 

Parental instruction 

	What this instruction actually  entails

	What Kiparsky assumes it entails

	You are not allowed to  go near the fire. (These  rules are asiddha.)

	The child will never burn his  hand. (Bleeding will never take  place).

	The child will never burn his  hand. (Bleeding will never take  place).

	You are allowed to go  near the fire. 

(These rules are siddha.)

	The child can potentially burn his  hand. He may or may not burn his  hand. (Bleeding can potentially  take place. It may or may not take  place.)

	The child will always burn his  hand. (Bleeding will always  take place).

	







I conclude that it is not logically possible to infer the siddha principle from vt. 1 on 6.1.86.  

Regardless of that, let me briefly comment on the following question: how useful is the siddha principle in dealing with cases of SSRI? As stated in chapter 6, the siddha principle rejects the  antaraṅga tool and essentially resorts to the nitya tool to solve not only those cases which the  tradition solves using nityatva, but also those which it solves using antaraṅgatva. Of course,  this means that the siddha principle is able to tackle cases of unidirectional blocking but not of  mutual blocking – which is one of its drawbacks.8 Another drawback of the siddha principle is  that it pays little attention to and offers no solutions for those cases of SSRI which do not  involve any blocking at all (‘non-conflict’). 

How useful is the siddha principle in dealing with cases of unidirectional blocking? Since the  siddha principle is no different from the nitya principle, albeit with a wider scope of application  than the traditional one, the answer to this question is the same as the answer to the question  about the potency of the nitya principle, which I have given in footnote 62 of chapter 4, and  which I reproduce here: “This is exactly why the traditional nitya tool which teaches that the  nitya rule defeats the anitya rule, always correctly resolves cases of DOI involving  

8 As stated towards the end of section 6.2 in chapter 6, Joshi and Kiparsky admit that, for mutual  blocking, “no general solution has been found” (Kiparsky 1987: 295) by them.

unidirectional blocking: the nitya rule is applicable to the RHS operand and the anitya rule to  the LHS operand. By (my interpretation of) 1.4.2, the RHS rule (which is also the nitya rule)  defeats the LHS rule (which is the anitya rule).” However, I do not know if the nitya / siddha principle is always correctly able to solve cases of SOI involving unidirectional blocking. A  majority of the examples discussed in Kiparsky (1982) involve DOI and not SOI. 

A major shortcoming of the nitya, and therefore the siddha principle, is its propensity to look  ahead into the derivation: one needs to know what will happen at the next step if, hypothetically speaking, a certain rule is applied at the presentstep. I think this very much qualifies as ‘looking  ahead’, even though it involves considering merely the potential – and not the actual – future  course of the derivation. Joshi and Kiparsky (2005) take this a step further by proposing the  extended siddha principle which ‘scans entire candidate derivations…’9 thanks to its ‘global  (trans-derivational) “lookahead” condition on derivations’10 ‘…and chooses the one in which  siddha-relations (i.e., bleeding and feeding)11 are maximized’12.13 In simple words, they ask us  to choose, from amongst all possible derivational paths, that derivational path in which the  nitya tool has been applied the highest number of times.  

Why does the derivational path in which siddha relations are maximized lead to the correct  answer though? It is easy to explain this with respect to DOI. In case of DOI, Pāṇini teaches us  (according to my interpretation of 1.4.2) that we must pick the RHS rule. But as we know (see  the footnoted reproduced above), it is the RHS rule which is also the nitya rule in cases of DOI  involving unidirectional blocking. So, it is natural that, of all the possible derivational paths,  the correct one has the highest number of instances in which the nitya (RHS rule) defeats the  anitya (LHS) rule – in cases of DOI involving unidirectional blocking. It is difficult to verify if Joshi and Kiparsky’s extended-siddha principle holds true with respect to SOI. 

Now let us ask: how useful is the extended siddha principle in resolving cases of SSRI? If one  has to chart out all possible derivational paths to make a decision, how is choosing the  derivational path in which siddha-relations are maximized any better than simply choosing the  derivational path which gives the correct grammatical form – which we know thanks to our

knowledge of Sanskrit? And in the latter case, why perform derivations at all if we have to rely  on the correct final form to choose the correct derivational path? 

Joshi and Kiparsky have discussed several examples in the aforementioned papers, a number of which I have solved using my method in this thesis. Please see Appendix D for relevant  tables of concordance. While it is not within the scope of this thesis to discuss in detail Joshi  and Kiparsky’s solutions for individual examples, we ought to study the work produced by  them in greater depth in the future to gain new insights into the functioning of Pāṇini’s  grammar.
