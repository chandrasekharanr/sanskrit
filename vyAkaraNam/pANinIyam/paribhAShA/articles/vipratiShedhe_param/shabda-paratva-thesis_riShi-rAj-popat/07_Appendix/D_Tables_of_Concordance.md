title = "D: Tables of Concordance"

+++

In this thesis, I have examined some derivational examples which have been previously  discussed by prominent modern scholars such as Kiparsky (1982), Bronkhorst (2004) and Joshi  and Kiparsky (2005). Below I give two tables of concordance. 

1) Kiparsky, P. (1982). The Ordering of Rules in Pāṇini’s Grammar. In Some Theoretical  Problems in Pāṇini's Grammar (pp. 77-120). Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute.

and  

Bronkhorst, J. (2004). From Pāṇini to Patañjali: The Search for Linearity. Bhandarkar Oriental  Research Institute. 

(Bronkhorst frequently quotes an unpublished draft of Joshi and Kiparsky in his paper. I think  this draft is the aforementioned paper that was published in 2005, after the publication of  Bronkhorst’s paper in 2004. It is for this reason that I have mentioned both papers together  here).
