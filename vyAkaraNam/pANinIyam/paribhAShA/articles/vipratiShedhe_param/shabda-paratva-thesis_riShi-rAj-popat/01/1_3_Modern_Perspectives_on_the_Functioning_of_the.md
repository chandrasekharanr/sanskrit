title = "1 3 Modern Perspectives on the Functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī"

+++

Before we explore how modern scholarship perceives the Aṣṭādhyāyī, let us very briefly  consider what the tradition, and more specifically Kātyāyana and Patañjali say, about the meaning and purpose of vyākaraṇa. In vt. 14 of the Paspaśāhnika24, Kātyāyana says:  lakṣyalakṣaṇe vyākaraṇam ‘grammar (stands for the combination of) lakṣya i.e., words (and  sentences)’ and lakṣaṇa ‘rules’. This is true of any grammar, not just the Aṣṭādhyāyī. But does  the Aṣṭādhyāyī have certain mechanistic properties which set it apart from conventional  grammars? Below we will look at modern perspectives on this topic. According to Patañjali25,  vyākaraṇa serves the following purposes: rakṣohāgamalaghvasandehāḥ “rakṣā ‘protection of  the Vedas’, ūha ‘adapting inflected forms in Vedic mantras as required during rituals’, āgama 

22 The earliest reordered commentary was the Rūpāvatāra of Dharmakīrti (10th century), but its  influence on the later kaumudī literature is uncertain.  

23 It is accompanied by Bhaṭṭojī’s auto-commentary on the Siddhāntakaumudī called  Prauḍhamanoramā. Two commentaries on the Siddhāntakaumudī are widely used to study it, namely  Vāsudeva Dīkṣita’s elaborate and beginner (lit. bāla ‘child’) -friendly Bālamanoramā, and Jñānendra Sarasvatī’s concise and advanced Tattvabodhinī (Cardona 1976: 285-286).

‘following Vedic injunctions’, laghu ‘brevity i.e., easy of learning the language’, and asandeha ‘resolution of doubts’”. These certainly are some of the factors that must have motivated Pāṇini  to write his grammar. But was Pāṇini also aiming to build a somewhat mechanistic model for  deriving Sanskrit words (and subsequently, sentences)? Let us look at what modern scholarship  tells us about topics like rule conflict and order of rule application in Pāṇinian derivations, and  therefore, about the status of the Aṣṭādhyāyī as a ‘machine’. 

Let us start by looking at Bronkhorst’s work on this topic. Bronkhorst (2004) shows that  Patañjali prefers a linear reading of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, that is, Patañjali believes that in order to  decide which rule should apply at any step in a derivation, one need not know the outcomes of  previous or following steps. He says, “It is clear from the above that Patañjali tries both to  avoid looking back and looking ahead in explaining grammatical derivations.”26 Bronkhorst  also points out that the Paribhāṣenduśekhara teaches the metarule  pūrvaparanityāntaraṅgāpavādānām uttarottaraṁ balīyaḥ (paribhāṣā 38) ‘Of [these five kinds  of rules, - viz.] a preceding [rule], a subsequent [rule]27, a nitya [rule]28, an antaraṅga [rule]29,  and an apavāda [rule]30, - each following [rule] possesses greater force [than any one of, or  all, the rules which in this paribhāṣā are mentioned before it].’31 He concludes: “…(this)32 clearly shows that, according to the traditional view, decisions concerning the continuation of

27 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam ‘The rule that comes later in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī wins  the rule conflict between two equally powerful rules.’  

28 Let us say that there is a conflict between rules A and B. A is called nitya with respect to B if A is  applicable (both before and) after the application of B (cf. Pbh 117 kr̥tākr̥taprasaṅgī yo vidhiḥ sa nityaḥ,  Vyāḍiparibhāṣāpāṭha). B is called anitya with respect to A if B is applicable before, but not after the  application of A. The nitya rule A is stronger than, and defeats the anitya rule B. 

29Paribhāṣenduśekhara, describes antaraṅga as follows: antarmadhye  bahiraṅgaśāstrīyanimittasamudāyamadhye’ ntarbhūtāny aṅgāni nimittāni yasya tad antaraṅgam. Kielhorn translates it as follows: ‘antaraṅga is (a rule) the causes (of the application) of which lie within  (or before) the sum of the causes of a bahiraṅga rule’. See Abhyankar’s reprint (second edition) of  Kielhorn’s work (1960: 221-222). 

30 An apavāda ‘exception’ is stronger than, and thus defeats, the utsarga ‘general’ rule in case of  conflict.

a grammatical derivation at any particular point are taken on the basis of the situation at hand.  More specifically, no information about the earlier or later phases of the derivation is required  to make a correct decision at any stage.”33 

Bronkhorst states that he is unconvinced by Patañjali’s evidence suggesting that the Aṣṭādhyāyī functions linearly. He thinks that Pāṇini did not intend for the Aṣṭādhyāyī to be approached  linearly, and attempts to establish that at least for some derivations, the knowledge of the  derivation’s history and/or its future course is essential to select the right rule at a given step.34 

One of the reasons Bronkhorst thinks looking ahead into the derivation is required is to  determine the order in which two rules should apply with respect to each other.35 Roodbergen  has a different opinion on this subject. 36 He recommends some changes to the traditional order  in which the following processes occur: the replacement of lakāras ‘tense and mood proxies’  with tiṄ ‘verbal endings’ and the introduction of vikaraṇas ‘affixes placed between verbal roots  and lakāras/the endings that replace lakāras’. This shows that Roodbergen does believe in  reading the Aṣṭādhyāyī linearly but disagrees to some extent with the tradition’s order of rule  application. And he thinks that this topic is not related to rule conflict and its resolution: ‘this  ordering principle has nothing to do with a feeding relation between rules in which the  application of one rule is made dependent on the effect of the application of another rule. It has  nothing to do either, with the question of conflict of rules. To solve a conflict, other principles  apply: paratva, siddha/asiddha37 and utsarga/apavāda.’ 

33 Bronkhorst 2004: 6. Patañjali says that para may mean iṣṭa ‘desirable’ in his commentary on 1.4.1  (iṣṭavācī paraśabdaḥ. vipratiṣedhe paraṁ yad iṣṭaṁ tad bhavati; Mbh I.306.9-10). According to  Bronkhorst, by iṣṭa, Patañjali means ‘the rule that he thinks should be applied’. I disagree with  Bronkhorst’s interpretation. I think by iṣṭa, Patañjali means ‘the rule that should be applied so as to get  the correct final form.’ This means that, in order to determine which rule is iṣṭa, one is required to know  the final form. And to know the final form, one needs to look ahead into the derivation. So, in my  opinion, this is an instance where Patañjali repudiates his linear reading of the Aṣṭādhyāyī.

37 A is siddha with respect to B if B recognizes the existence of A. Likewise, A is asiddha ‘not siddha’  with respect to B if B does not recognize the existence of A.

Scholars working on rule conflict have peripherally addressed the topic of linearity. Cardona  says that ‘the derivational prehistory of a form is pertinent to the operations which apply to  it.’38 Joshi and Kiparsky think that it is important to look ahead into a derivation. They propose  the extended siddha principle which they claim governs Pāṇinian derivations and which ‘scans  entire candidate derivations…’39 thanks to its ‘global (trans-derivational) “lookahead”  condition on derivations’40 ‘…and chooses the one in which siddha-relations (bleeding and  feeding)41 are maximized’42. So, both Cardona and Joshi & Kiparsky, do not support an  exclusively linear reading of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. 

According to Houben43, ‘a comparison between Pāṇini’s grammar and “a machine” may be  useful in demonstrating some of the features and procedures it incorporates, but the comparison  has now and then been carried too far.’ He continues: ‘in fact, in the practice of Pāṇinīyas  through the ages up to the present, no-one can ever have produced a correct form through  Pāṇini’s system that was not already his starting point, or among his starting options … the  system is therefore not well characterized as “synthetic”, even if synthetic procedures are  central and most visible; rather the system is to be called “reconstitutive” - which implies the  presence of a user, a preliminary statement, and the application of both analytic and synthetic  procedures to the words in it … aiming at the best possible, saṁskr̥ta form of his preliminary  statement.’44 He attributes the reception of Pāṇinian grammar as a machine to Bhaṭṭojī Dīkṣita’s  Siddhāntakaumudī and Nāgeśa’s Paribhāṣenduśekhara: ‘in order to provide the desired solid  authoritative basis to Sanskrit grammar it was moreover necessary to posit it as a closed system  of rules and metarules – something it had never been in a true sense of this term for around two  millennia, although Kātyāyana's and Patañjali's investigations on selected sūtras had prepared

the ground for such an approach. The culmination in this trend came only a few generations  later with Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa's Paribhāṣenduśekhara…’45 

Let us summarize what we have surveyed so far. Houben is not in favour of perceiving the  Aṣṭādhyāyī as a derivational machine, thereby also implicitly dismissing both the concept of  linearity and consistent conflict-resolution procedures. Roodbergen believes that the  Aṣṭādhyāyī is a derivational machine, proposes his own version of a linear reading of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī. Roodbergen also argues that the order of rule application and resolution of rule  conflict are not related or associated with each other. Bronkhorst claims that the existence of  paribhāṣā 38 of the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, which creates a hierarchy of conflict resolution  tools (in addition to Patañjali’s statements), indicates that the tradition prefers a linear reading  of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. In doing so, Bronkhorst establishes a correlation between consistent rule  conflict resolution procedures and a linear reading of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. Bronkhorst rejects the  linear approach. On the other hand, Joshi & Kiparsky and Cardona seem to think that their  rejection of a strictly linear reading of the Aṣṭādhyāyī does not substantially undermine the  mechanistic prowess of the Pāṇinian system, and devote much of their scholarly attention to  solving rule conflict.  

While the functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī remains the primary focus of this thesis, we shall also  look at its interactions with the structure of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. Let me first outline how the  Aṣṭādhyāyī is structured. The rules of the Aṣṭādhyāyī are organized on the basis of their  purpose: rules teaching certain saṁjñās are grouped together, rules about a certain substitute 

are placed together and so on and so forth. In most such groups, the apavāda sūtras ‘exception  rules’ are listed immediately after the utsarga sūtras ‘general rules’. These groups of rules are  themselves placed in one of the eight books depending on their role: saṁjñā sūtras ‘definition  rules’ and paribhāṣā sutras ‘metarules’ are generally placed in the first two adhyāyas, rules  teaching affixation in the following three, and rules teaching morpho-phonological changes in  the last three.  

The structure and organization of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, that is, the general arrangement and serial  order of rules in the Aṣṭādhyāyī, have an influence on its functioning in different ways. In the  opinion of the tradition, 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam teaches that in the case of conflict  between two equally powerful rules, the rule that appears later in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order

wins, which implies that the serial order of rules in the Aṣṭādhyāyī has a direct impact on rule  conflict resolution.  

Pāṇini has ingeniously composed three asiddha sections, headed respectively by 6.1.86  ṣatvatukor asiddhaḥ46, 6.4.22 asiddhavad atrābhāt and 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham. 6.4.22 teaches  us that two rules treat each other as asiddhavat ‘as if suspended’ when both lie within 6.4.22- 12947, which helps avoid certain undesirable instances of rule conflict. 8.2.1 teaches us that  from there onwards, a preceding rule treats any following rule as asiddha ‘suspended’, which  helps facilitate or avoid the application of certain rules. Here too, the position of one rule with  respect to other rules has a significant impact on Pāṇinian derivations or the functioning of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī. 

Interestingly, the functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī may have had an impact on its structure too.  Roodbergen argues that ‘the word building process proceeds in what is visually a left-to-right  direction’.48 According to Roodbergen, this direction of word-building which underlies the  functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, impacts its structure, that is, the positioning of rules in different  books and chapters of the Aṣṭādhyāyī: ‘rules dealing with left-side elements are introduced  earlier [in earlier sections of the Aṣṭādhyāyī]49 than rules dealing with right-side elements’50. 

We have seen what the existing literature on the subject says about the functioning of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī and its connection with its structure. In this thesis, I share my research on rule  interaction, and then go on to show how these findings shed light on the functioning of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī. I conclude that Pāṇini did intend for the Aṣṭādhyāyī to be interpreted linearly and  as a closed grammatical machine. Before I share my understanding of rule interaction, let us  first look at the tradition’s views on this subject. 

46 A single replacement of the preceding and the following sounds is suspended (asiddha) with respect  to rules teaching replacement with ṣ (ṣatva) and the introduction of augment tUK. 47 According to the Kāśikā, and broadly, the tradition, the scope of 6.4.22 continues up to the end of  6.4. I will discuss this in detail in chapter 5.
