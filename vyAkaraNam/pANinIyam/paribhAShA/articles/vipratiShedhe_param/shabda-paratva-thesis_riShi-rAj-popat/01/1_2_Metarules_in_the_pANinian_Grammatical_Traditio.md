[[11]]

Early grammatical thought in the Indian subcontinent, as represented by the works called  Prātiśākhyas, was intended to assist the recitation of Vedas by explaining the pronunciation of  accents and dissolution of sandhis. Their objective was merely descriptive, that is, to make  grammatical observations and offer clarifications where necessary. But a number of independent and full-fledged grammars emerged subsequently which sought to ‘derive’  language rather than simply ‘describe’ it: they built mechanistic systems which perform various  operations on bases and affixes in order to produce correct word forms and, using these fully  derived words, to construct meaningful sentences.  

While Pāṇini himself mentions many of his predecessors in his sūtras, his work, the  Aṣṭādhyāyī, remains the oldest surviving derivational grammar of Sanskrit. Composing such a  grammar required Pāṇini to meticulously design every aspect of the derivational procedure,  which explains why Pāṇini made significant efforts in formulating his paribhāṣā sūtras  ‘metarules’. These metarules play a pivotal role in the correct interpretation and application of  vidhi sūtras ‘operation rules’ at every step of the derivation, thereby ensuring that the  derivational machine produces the grammatically correct output. 

Given the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s remarkable exhaustiveness and accuracy, it is not surprising that  Kātyāyana, around 250 BC[^15], undertook a systematic analysis of what must have been for him  an unprecedented and extraordinary treatise. Kātyāyana recorded his thoughts and findings in  the form of vārttikas, which are short statements seeking to explain, examine, criticize and  sometimes integrate Pāṇini’s rules with additions. Without overlooking the more specific and  individual aspects of the grammar, Kātyāyana sought to develop a broad perspective about the  functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī as an integrated machine. This involved interpreting the  metarules of Pāṇini’s grammar, providing examples and counterexamples to determine their  verity, and composing new metarules to help the Pāṇinian system run even more smoothly. 

Around 150 BC, Patañjali wrote the Mahābhāṣya, which is a commentary on Kātyāyana’s  vārttikas.[^16] It records the arguments and counter-arguments that must have transpired between  Patañjali and his pupils about the contents of the vārttikas. Patañjali too approached the  Aṣṭādhyāyī with his independent perspective about its derivational system, and skilfully wove  Kātyāyana’s vārttikas into his own presentation of the Pāṇinian machine. In doing so, he both  established his independent interpretation of Pāṇini’s and Kātyāyana’s metarules, and wrote  new metarules to afford us greater clarity to the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s derivational procedure.

In the course of time, some Pāṇinīyas took it upon themselves to compile and comment on all  such metarules from Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya. They also came up with new metarules to fill the knowledge gaps that they thought existed in the tradition. They came to be known as  paribhāṣākāras ‘authors of paribhāṣās’, and the literature composed by them, as paribhāṣā literature.+++(5)+++ Paribhāṣā texts have been written over many centuries – from around[^17] (or soon  after) Patañjali’s time, if not before him, to the 18th century. Among the paribhāṣā texts of the  Pāṇinian tradition, the most popularly studied, quoted and commented upon in modern times  is the relatively recent Paribhāṣenduśekhara of Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa, which was written in the  eighteenth century.  

A rich tradition of paribhāṣā literature has long existed in other schools of Sanskrit grammar  too (e.g., Kātantra, Haima, Cāndra).[^18] Both Pāṇinian and non-Pāṇinian paribhāṣākāras were  especially interested in certain topics, for example, rule conflict. In Nāgeśa’s work, the section  containing paribhāṣās 38 to 70 deals exclusively with rule conflict and is thus called  bādhabīja.[^19] Similarly, in the Kātantra system, paribhāṣā sūtras are actually divided into  balābala sūtras ‘metarules dealing with comparison of rule strength’ and others which do not  deal with this topic.[^20] A significant exchange of ideas took place between Pāṇinian and non Pāṇinian traditions due to mutual borrowing of paribhāṣās. 

Circa 7th century AD, Jayāditya and Vāmana wrote the Kāśikā, which consists of vr̥ttis on each  rule.[^21] A vr̥tti paraphrases the rule, teaches metarules that help us correctly apply that rule,  gives examples of its application, and justifies the existence of each word of that rule.+++(4)+++ Vr̥ttis  borrow a significant proportion of their contents from Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya. They are unique  in that they do not comprise new metarules, yet by quoting some metarules from Patañjali’s  Mahābhāṣya and ignoring others, they present an evolved perspective about the mechanistic  aspects of Pāṇinian derivations – often quite different from Patañjali’s.

Lastly, let us talk about kaumudī texts, which explicitly envision the Aṣṭādhyāyī as a  grammatical machine. The kaumudī tradition which began in the fifteenth century with Rāmacandra’s Prakriyākaumudī[^22], reorders the sūtras of the Aṣṭādhyāyī to reflect their  derivational roles: in any Kaumudī text, a rule is introduced when the first derivation involving  it is taught. The Kaumudī texts first introduce saṁjñā and paribhāṣā rules, then teach sandhi rules, then introduce nominal and verbal inflections in the order in which forms appear in  paradigms, and then teach derivatives and compounds. The most celebrated text in this genre  is Bhaṭṭojī Dīkṣita’s Siddhāntakaumudī written in the seventeenth century.[^23] By reordering the  Aṣṭādhyāyī’s rules, the Kaumudī not only gives us a glimpse of how Pāṇini’s derivational  mechanism actually works, but also tells us which metarules apply where, and how these  metarules enable the us to perform derivations uniformly. 

[^22]: The earliest recordered commentary was the Rūpāvatāra of Dharmakīrti (10th century), but its  influence on the later kaumudī literature is uncertain.

[^23]: It is accompanied by Bhaṭṭojī’s auto-commentary on the Siddhāntakaumudī called  Prauḍhamanoramā. Two commentaries on the Siddhāntakaumudī are widely used to study it, namely  Vāsudeva Dīkṣita’s elaborate and beginner (lit. bāla ‘child’) -friendly Bālamanoramā, and Jñānendra Sarasvatī’s concise and advanced Tattvabodhinī (Cardona 1976: 285-286).

Even though the traditional texts discussed above broadly agree on most derivational  technicalities, they present different perspectives on the nature and characteristics of the  machine.
