Let us look at 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam again. Pāṇini does not explain the meaning of  vipratiṣedha in the Aṣṭādhyāyī. The Kāśikā claims that vipratiṣedha means tulyabalavirodha ‘conflict between two equally powerful rules.’ This is a plausible assumption because, in  Sanskrit literature, the term has been used to mean ‘the opposition of two courses of action  which are equally important, the conflict of two even-matched interests’59. But which conflicts  qualify as tulyabala ‘having equal strength’? The Kāśikā says that rule pairs which are not  nitya-anitya, antaraṅga-bahiraṅga, apavāda-utsarga are tulyabala ‘having equal strength’.  

Let us try to understand why the tradition felt the need to come up with these tools. According  to the tradition, para in 1.4.2 means ‘the rule that appears after another in the serial order of  the Aṣṭādhyāyī’. Thus, in the case of a conflict (vipratiṣedha) between two rules, the operation  prescribed by the later rule should prevail. However, if one assumes that any rule conflict can  be called vipratiṣedha, and therefore applies 1.4.2 uniformly to every instance of such a  conflict, in many cases one gets the wrong answer at the end of the derivation. Let us consider  a few examples: tud is a 6th class root which can take both parasmaipada ‘active’ and ātmanepada ‘middle’ endings.  

When deriving its present third person singular form, two rules become applicable at the step  tud + tiP. One is 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca (sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ guṇaḥ)60,  which teaches that the penultimate light vowel iK (i, u, r̥, l̥) is replaced with guṇa (a, e, o) when  followed by a sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix. The other is 3.1.77 tudādibhyaḥ śaḥ 

(sārvadhātuke kartari), which teaches the addition of affix Śa after roots belonging to the class  starting with tud in the Dhātupāṭha, when the root is followed by a sārvadhātuka affix in an

active construction. Note that, since 7.3.86 comes after 3.1.77 in the serial order of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī, according to the traditional understanding of 1.4.2 it should win, but applying  7.3.86 would give the wrong answer: tod + tiP (7.3.86) 🡪 tod + Śa + tiP (3.1.77) 🡪 *todati.  

Notice that 3.1.77 is applicable after 7.3.86 applies, as seen in the derivation above. On the  other hand, if 3.1.77 applies first, we get: tud + Śa + tiP. Since Śa is marked with a Ś, it is  sārvadhātuka by 3.4.113 tiṅśit sārvadhātukam, and being a sārvadhātuka which is not marked  with a P, it is treated as if marked by Ṅ by 1.2.4 sārvadhātukam apit (ṅit). By 1.1.5 kṅiti ca (na  iko guṇavr̥ddhī), the guṇa replacement of u in tud by 7.3.86 is no longer possible. So 7.3.86 is  not applicable once 3.1.77 has applied.  

Thus, 3.1.77 and 7.3.86 are nitya and anitya respectively. If the nitya rule, i.e., 3.1.77 wins, we  get: tud + Śa + tiP (3.1.77) 🡪 tudati, which is the correct answer. In this example, relying on  paratva gives the wrong answer, but using nityatva gives the right answer. We shall come back  to this after we look at a few more examples.  

Consider the next example: to derive syona ‘a sack, something stitched’, na is added to siv ‘to  sew, stitch’: siv + na (3.3.1 uṇādayo bahulam).61 First, by 6.4.1962 chvoḥ śūḍ anunāsike ca  (kvijhaloḥ kṅiti), v of siv is replaced with ū: (siū) + na. Now, two rules are simultaneously  applicable here: 6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci, which is caused by ū and prescribes the replacement of i  with y, and 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca, which is caused by na and prescribes the  replacement of i of si with its corresponding guṇa (i.e., e). Since 7.3.86 comes after 6.1.77 in  the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, by 1.4.2 it should win. But applying 7.3.86 gives us the  wrong answer. 

According to the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, ‘antaraṅga is (a rule) the causes (of the application)  of which lie within (or before) the sum of the causes of a bahiraṅga rule’. So, in the case of siū  + na, ū, the cause of 6.1.77, lies before (i.e., to the left of) na, the cause of 7.3.86. Thus, 6.1.77  

61 This is one of only two sūtras that refer to an ancillary text known as Uṇādisūtras, which provide for  introducing certain affixes after verb roots to derive nominal bases (Cardona 1976: 170). There is no  clear consensus about whether or not Pāṇini himself wrote the Uṇādisūtras (Cardona 1976: 174). I  personally do not think he did, and so I do not consider this derivation ‘Pāṇinīya’. But because the  commentarial tradition uses this as an example in the present context, I discuss it nonetheless. The  relevant Uṇādi sūtra here is 289 siveṣ ṭer yū ca. 

62 I am aware that the tradition reads this rule as cchvoḥ… and not as chvoḥ…. However, I think that  the original version must have been chvoḥ. See Kiparsky 1982: 89.

is antaraṅga whereas 7.3.86 is bahiraṅga. Using the antaraṅgatva tool, 6.1.77 wins. We get  syū + na 🡪 syo + na (sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ) 🡪 syona, which is the correct answer.  Relying on paratva gives the wrong answer, while using antaraṅgatva gives the right answer.  

Let us look at one more example. Two rules, namely 1.4.16 siti ca (padam) and 1.4.18 yaci  bham (svādiṣv asarvanāmasthāne) lie in the ekā saṁjñā section (1.4.1 ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā). 1.4.1 teaches that up to 2.2.38 kaḍārāḥ karmadhāraye, any item can take only one saṁjñā ‘technical designation’. 1.4.16 siti ca (padam) teaches that an item is called pada when an affix  marked with S follows, and 1.4.18 yaci bham (svādiṣv asarvanāmasthāne) teaches that an item  is called bha when a y- or vowel-initial, non-sarvanāmasthāna affix belonging to the class  starting with sU follows. Consider the example ūrṇā + yuS.63 Here ūrṇā can potentially take  two saṁjñās: pada by 1.4.16 and bha by 1.4.18. However, since both rules lie within the  jurisdiction of 1.4.1, ūrṇā can take only one of the two saṁjñās. By 1.4.2, the para rule i.e., 1.4.18 should win. But if ūrṇā takes the bha saṁjñā, then ā of ūrṇā gets deleted by 6.4.148  yasyeti ca (bhasya lopaḥ taddhite), which teaches that the final i or a (both short and long) of  an item which is termed bha are deleted when followed by an ī or a taddhita affix. This gives  us the wrong taddhita stem *ūrṇyu. The Kāśikā says that 1.4.16 is an apavāda of 1.4.18 without  justifying this claim.64 If the apavādatva tool is used, 1.4.16 wins, which gives the correct stem  ūrṇāyu. Using paratva gives the wrong answer, while using apavādatva gives the right answer.  

In all three examples discussed above, using paratva gives the wrong answer, but using  nityatva, antaraṅgatva and apavādatva respectively leads to the correct answer. Below, I  present an abridged version of how I think the current method of solving rule conflict has  gradually evolved. Having realized that treating all rule conflicts as vipratiṣedha and applying  

63 5.2.123 ūrṇāyā yus ‘The taddhita suffix yuS occurs to denote the sense of matUP after syntactically  related nominal stem ūrṇā “wool”’. 

64 I agree with Cardona’s (1970: 46) explanation for this: “Consider now 1.4.16. There are only four  affixes marked with S in Pāṇini’s grammar: ghaS (🡪 iya by 7.1.2) introduced by 5.1.106, chaS (🡪 īya,  7.1.2) by 4.2.114-5, yaS (ya) by 5.2.138, and yuS (🡪 aka, 7.1.1) by 5.2.123, 138, 140. For example,  r̥tviya- ‘tempestivus’ (<r̥tu ‘appropriate time, season’) contains ghaS. All such affixes are taddhita 

(4.1.76: taddhitāḥ), included among the affixes referred to in 1.4.17-8, and all also begin with y or a  vowel. Hence, items occurring before these are eligible for being bha by 1.4.18.” With the help of this  information, we can infer that 1.4.18 is applicable wherever 1.4.16 is applicable, but 1.4.16 is not always  applicable where 1.4.18 is. 1.4.16 is more specific than 1.4.18 and thus wins.

25 

1.4.2 uniformly to every instance of such a conflict gives the wrong answer in many cases, the  Pāṇinīyas: 

(1) claimed that they found jñāpakas ‘hints or clues’ in Pāṇini’s sūtras which authorised them  to devise new tools like nityatva, antaraṅgatva, anavakāśatva, etc., for the purpose of solving  rule conflicts; 

(2) restricted the jurisdiction of rule 1.4.2 by declaring that vipratiṣedha implies only tulyabala conflicts, i.e., conflicts between equally powerful rules; and 

(3) declared that rule pairs like nitya-anitya, antaraṅga-bahiraṅga, and anavakāśa-sāvakāśa were to be called atulyabala ‘not equally powerful’. 

This allowed them to exclude the atulyabala rule pairs, namely nitya-anitya, antaraṅga bahiraṅga etc., from the jurisdiction of 1.4.2, thereby containing the problems caused by their  interpretation of 1.4.2 to a smaller number of cases. Gradually, the Pāṇinīyas also constructed  the hierarchy taught in paribhāṣā 38 of Paribhāṣenduśekhara above to determine which tool  takes precedence over which other tools. 

However, these post-Pāṇinian tools are not without flaws, to compensate for which umpteen  other paribhāṣās have been written by Pāṇinīyas. Many of these paribhāṣās address very  specific cases65 or even single examples of conflict, thereby defeating the entire purpose of  writing metarules, which is to arrive at broad generalizations that can govern the application of  and interactions between the whole body of rules. And even after this, the Pāṇinīyas are not  able to solve every case of conflict correctly: every time they falter, they find one tortuous  explanation or the other to justify that ‘exception’. 

I do not think that all paribhāṣās taught by the Pāṇinīyas should be rejected. Many post Pāṇinian paribhāṣās accurately capture how the Pāṇinian machine functions, and thus they are  of great importance to us. They are mostly descriptive in nature and make insightful  observations about the Aṣṭādhyāyī. However, we also find post-Pāṇinian paribhāṣās that teach  us tools for rule conflict resolution, such as nityatva and antaraṅgatva, which Pāṇini would  

65 For example, consider Pbh 52 of the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, antaraṅgān api vidhīn bahiraṅgo lug bādhate ‘A bahiraṅga rule teaching LUK deletion defeats an antaraṅga rule [in case of conflict]’, which  is an exception of Pbh 50 antaraṅge bahiraṅgam asiddham ‘An antaraṅga rule treats a bahiraṅga rule  as suspended.’

26 

certainly not have left unstated if he actually wanted to teach them, and which impose post Pāṇinian ideas onto the Aṣṭādhyāyī. Thus, the validity of this set of paribhāṣās is questionable.
