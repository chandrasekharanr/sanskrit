In my view, firstly, Pāṇini did not expect us to create the categories ‘tulyabala’ and  ‘atulyabala’. Secondly, I think that he taught 1.4.2 as a metarule which, rather than being  restricted to a particular section of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, is applicable to the entire Aṣṭādhyāyī. 

More broadly, I do not agree with both the traditional and the modern perspectives towards this  topic, because instead of trying to decipher the actual meaning of 1.4.2, these approaches try  to brush 1.4.2 under the carpet, to make it less effective or to weaken its impact. One does it  

[^75]: Besides, there are some cases which may appear to be conflicts between rules teaching kāraka saṁjñās but which, according to me, are not conflicts at all. For example, whether one says geham praviśati (cf. 1.4.49 kartur īpsitatamaṁ karma 🡪 2.3.2 karmaṇi dvitīyā) or gehe praviśati (cf. 1.4.45  ādhāro’dhikaraṇam 🡪 2.3.36 saptamy adhikaraṇe ca) depends entirely on the non-linguistic feature  that the speaker wishes to express - that is, whether he/she wants to express kartur īpsitatama or ādhāra. So, this choice lies outside the domain of Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī. In conclusion, in my opinion, rule  conflict does not arise between 1.4.45 and 1.4.49.

by excluding certain rule pairs from the scope of vipratiṣedha, and the other by reducing the  jurisdiction of 1.4.2. This approach which seeks to undervalue Pāṇini’s rule interaction mechanism and replaces it with self-invented methods of ‘rule conflict resolution’ can lead to  some success for a limited set or specific type of examples, but does not allow us to understand  and appreciate the larger picture.  

To get instructions about dealing with rule interaction, I try to rely, as much as possible, upon  ‘internal metarules’, that is, those metarules which Pāṇini has taught in his work, setting aside  any ‘external metarules’, that is, those metarules that are not found in the Aṣṭādhyāyī, such as  nityatva, antaraṅgatva, post-Pāṇinian paribhāṣās from the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, vārttikas 

that discuss rule interaction etc. In this thesis, I have come up with my own interpretation of  1.4.2 and, using that, I have reinterpreted Pāṇini’s derivational mechanism. I have attempted  to show that Pāṇini’s grammatical machine is self-sufficient, that is, its own (internal)  metarules, are able to run it with remarkable perfection, and that no external metarules are able  or required to aid this process.
