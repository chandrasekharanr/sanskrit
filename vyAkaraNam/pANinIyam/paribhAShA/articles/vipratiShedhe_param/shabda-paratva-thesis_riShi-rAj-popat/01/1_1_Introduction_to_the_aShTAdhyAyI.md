title = "1 1 Introduction to the Aṣṭādhyāyī"

+++

Pāṇini1 composed the Aṣṭādhyāyī around 350 BC2 in North-Western South Asia.3 The  Aṣṭādhyāyī is a samāhāra ‘collection’ of aṣṭa(n) ‘eight’ adhyāyas ‘books’, hence the name  Aṣṭa-adhyāy(a)-ī. Each book of the Aṣṭādhyāyī has four pādas ‘chapters’ that are made up of  sūtras ‘rules’. In all, the Aṣṭādhyāyī comprises about 4000 rules. The Aṣṭādhyāyī is a  comprehensive grammar of the Sanskrit language as known to its author Pāṇini. It stands out  for doing more than merely describing its object language: the Aṣṭādhyāyī is a full-fledged  machine which helps construct grammatically correct Sanskrit words and sentences through a  step-by-step derivation4 process. In the Aṣṭādhyāyī, Pāṇini does not give us a general  introduction to his work, nor does he discuss the theoretical principles that have been used to  construct his sūtras. He conveys whatever has to be said, through his sūtras alone. 

The first two books are mainly composed of saṁjñā sūtras ‘definition rules’ and paribhāṣā  sūtras ‘metarules’5. The remaining books mainly consist of vidhi sūtras ‘operational rules’.  Books three to five teach the addition of both inflectional and derivational affixes to bases.  Book three teaches the addition of various affixes to verbal roots and stems, and books four  and five teach the addition of different affixes to nominal stems. Books six, seven and eight  teach various morpho-phonological operations that should be performed on both bases and

3 I say ‘composed’ and not ‘wrote’ because scholars disagree on whether he used the aid of writing to  create his grammar. In recent times, Vergiani (2020) has present strong arguments in favour of the  proposition that Pāṇini did use written means to put together his magnum opus. Writing or not, it is  known that, just as happened with the Vedas, the Aṣṭādhyāyī too was orally transmitted from one  generation to the next. 

4 In the modern literature on the Pāṇinian grammatical tradition, it is customary to use the verb ‘to  derive’ and its derivatives (e.g., derivation) to simply mean ‘to construct’. The verb ‘to derive’ is used  in the context of not only derivational but also inflectional morphology. I shall abide by this convention  in this thesis. 

5 Metarules teach us how rules should be interpreted, how certain operations should be undertaken, and  how rules interact with one another.

affixes. Different kinds of rules from multiple books are required to derive a word using  Pāṇini’s method. 

To truly understand the Aṣṭādhyāyī, one needs to familiarize oneself with the methodology  used by Pāṇini to compose and arrange rules in his work. Pāṇini’s style is not entirely self evident, and one faces challenges at multiple levels when attempting to unravel the enigma that  is the Aṣṭādhyāyī. Firstly, it is not easy to determine the exact meanings of Pāṇini’s rules  because the sūtra style in which they are composed is very concise and compact. Much  information is often packed into a few words, thereby making it considerably difficult to  comprehend their exact purport. Consider 6.1.9 sanyaṅoḥ, which teaches that a verbal base6,  which has not undergone reduplication, undergoes reduplication in the presence of affixes saN7 and yaṄ, the desiderative and intensive markers, respectively.8 The question about whether  sanyaṅoḥ is a genitive dual or a locative dual is a crucial one, and has important implications  for how we conceptualize prakriyā ‘the (derivational) procedure’.9 

Secondly, to make sense of any given rule, it is essential to take into account the contents of  preceding rules. This is because Pāṇini uses a device called anuvr̥tti ‘continuation into the  following rules’ to economically express his observations: to understand the complete and  correct meaning of a rule, certain words from preceding sūtras may need to be borrowed into  that rule by anuvr̥tti. But there is no universal convention as to which terms are supposed to or  can become anuvr̥tta ‘continued’ into a certain rule. For example, consider 1.1.33  prathamacaramatayālpārdhakatipayanemāś ca, which teaches that certain words are called  sarvanāma. But it is difficult to determine whether or not the words from the previous rule  1.1.32 vibhāṣā jasi should be continued into this rule. If they are continued into 1.1.33, then  

6 Note that the whole base does not undergo reduplication. Instead, only one syllable does. See 6.1.1  ekāco dve prathamasya and 6.1.2 ajāder dvitīyasya. 

7 In this thesis, I use capital letters in Pāṇinian morphemes to represent itsaṁjñakas (taught in 1.3.2  upadeśe’j anunāsika it and following sūtras). Such its (commonly called anubandhas in post-Pāṇinian  grammatical literature) are used to mark certain properties of the item to which they are added, and are  not actually part of the item. Their unconditional deletion is taught by 1.3.9 tasya lopaḥ. 

8 Note that, in this thesis, I have used English translations of Pāṇini’s rules by Sharma (1987-2003) and  Katre (1987), for many but not all rules. I have taken the liberty to edit their translations as required.  For the remaining rules, I have presented my own translations.

this would restrict 1.1.33 only to those cases where these stems are followed by the nominative  plural affix Jas, and would also make 1.1.33 optional.10 

Thirdly, even after the meaning of the rule has been understood, it does not become patently  obvious how to use it. This is because Pāṇini’s rules are placed together on the basis of topical  and functional categories, and not according to the derivations in which they participate.11 Thus, one cannot easily ascertain the order in which rules apply or select the step at which they  become applicable. For example, consider the rule 3.1.33 syatāsī lr̥luṭoḥ, which teaches that  the affixes sya and tāsI should be added to the left of LR̥ (LR̥Ṭ and LR̥Ṅ) and LUṬ respectively.  But the question that has troubled both traditional and modern scholars is: should and can this  rule apply before the lakāras are replaced with finite verb endings (3.4.77 lasya; 3.4.78 tip-tas jhi…12)?13 

Fourthly, after one has come to a conclusion about where to apply a given rule, one is often  faced with situations in which two rules become applicable at the same step. In many such  cases, one rule blocks the other, or both rules block each other. This is called ‘rule conflict’.  According to the tradition, a metarule taught by Pāṇini, namely 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ 

kāryam addresses this issue. However, it seems unable to give the right answer when applied  to certain cases of conflict. 

We can conclude that the Aṣṭādhyāyī is a very sophisticated grammar, and that to operate its  grammatical machine, we have to understand it at multiple levels. What would an early  grammarian or linguist have done in order to interpret the Aṣṭādhyāyī independently? With  negligible access to any commentary on the text, and with limited or no guidance of a teacher  well-versed in the Aṣṭādhyāyī, a scholar would have taken notes for himself in order to  comprehend, analyse and corroborate the teachings of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. He would have started  by paraphrasing the contents of the Aṣṭādhyāyī to establish what they exactly mean, both  independently and in the context of the preceding rules.

11 Besides, it is not possible to arrange rules on the basis of the derivations in which they participate  because most rules participate in umpteen different derivations.

10To ensure that he had understood such a complex grammar correctly, or to confirm that the  grammar accurately describes the structure of the language, a scholar would have tried to verify  the validity and accuracy of different rules against spoken language or attested literature. He would have gradually developed his own ideas about where rules should apply, and how  derivations should proceed. He would have noticed how rules interact amongst themselves and  would have come up with ways to classify and deal with such interactions. He would also have  suggested certain changes to these rules to make them more precise, to help them better  characterize their object language and/or to help them function more consistently with other  rules within the Pāṇinian system. 

This is presumably what happened in the Indian grammatical tradition when Kātyāyana  understood the meanings and functions of Pāṇinian rules on the basis of his independent study  of the Aṣṭādhyāyī.14 Then as a teacher, he also taught them to his pupils using his notes on the Aṣṭādhyāyī as pedagogical aid. His students taught the Aṣṭādhyāyī to their students using  Kātyāyana’s work and also commented on Kātyāyana’s writings, thereby sharing their own  opinions, interpretations and analyses with their students and readers. Successive generations  participated in this process of knowledge processing, production and transmission, thereby  giving birth to the Pāṇinian grammatical tradition.  

The texts of the Pāṇinian grammatical tradition have played a dominant role in influencing and  shaping our understanding of, and opinions about the Aṣṭādhyāyī. They also give us significant  insights into the evolution of different ideas in the Pāṇinian tradition. Below I introduce the  texts that I shall refer to in the rest of the thesis and briefly discuss the history of the Pāṇinian  tradition with special reference to metarules.
