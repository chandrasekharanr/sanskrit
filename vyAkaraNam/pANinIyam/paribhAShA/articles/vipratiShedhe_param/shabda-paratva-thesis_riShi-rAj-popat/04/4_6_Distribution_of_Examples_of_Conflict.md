title = "4 6 Distribution of Examples of Conflict"

+++

Now let us examine the distribution of examples of conflict across various kinds of derivations  (e.g., subanta, kr̥danta etc.). Since Pāṇini uses the general-exception framework throughout  the Aṣṭādhyāyī, we find cases of SOI conflict in all kinds of derivations. And while we might  find more examples of SOI conflict in some kinds of derivations than others, we do not come  across any unique or peculiar patterns that merit discussion here. 

So, I will focus on the distribution of DOI conflicts in Pāṇinian derivations in this section. Let  us inquire why, on the whole, DOI conflicts, and especially certain kinds of DOI conflicts (e.g.,  mutual blocking), are found more frequently in certain kinds of derivations than others. I  request the reader to bear in mind that I will be making some broad generalizations here in  order to paint an overarching picture. Therefore, my statements will not be entirely accurate. 

Since we are talking about DOI-conflict here, I will not touch upon those instances of DOI  which do not involve conflict.  

To start with, let us consider subanta derivations. 

‘nominal base + declensional affix’ 

 A B 

We will focus on cases where the application of A to the base is triggered by the first sound of  the affix, and the application of B to the affix is triggered by the last sound of the base. If the  first sound of the affix changes, A is not applicable to the base anymore and if the last sound  of the base changes, B is not applicable to the affix anymore. Therefore, when two such rules  are simultaneously applicable in subanta derivations, A to the base and B to the affix, both  rules block each other, leading to a situation of DOI conflict. See examples 1-5 and 9 of section  2.7, chapter 2.  

In other cases, we find that the application of B to the affix is triggered simply by the  grammatical gender, word category (e.g., pronoun) etc. of the base. In such a case, even if the 

165 

base undergoes phonological change, B will still be applicable at the following step. On the  contrary, we observe that the application of A to the base is triggered by the first sound or the  mere presence of an affix. So, if the affix is deleted, for example, by LUK, or if its first sound  changes, then A will no longer be applicable at the following step. These are cases of unidirectional blocking. See examples 6-8 and 13 of section 2.7, chapter 2. 

Thus, we see both kinds of examples of DOI conflict, namely those of mutual blocking and  those of unidirectional blocking, in subanta derivations. Note that I have overlooked, for the  sake of simplicity, examples of DOI conflict where both rules apply to two different parts of  the base or to two different parts of the affix respectively. 

Let us contrast this with tiṅanta derivations. One of the early steps of these derivations looks  like this: 

‘verbal base + vikaraṇa + finite ending’ 

 C D E 

Vikaraṇas on the whole do not undergo many changes. Even when they do, the application of  D (which may teach replacement with LUK or other substitutes, augmentation, etc.) is not  triggered by the last sound of the verbal root. So even if the verbal root undergoes some  changes, D will still be applicable to the vikaraṇa at the following step. On the other hand, the  application of C (which may entail guṇa, samprasāraṇa, augmentation, lengthening of the  penultimate vowel, deletion of nasal etc.) is dependent on the existence of the vikaraṇa, its  being marked with K or Ṅ, etc. So, if the vikaraṇa undergoes certain changes, such as  replacement with LUK or attachment of certain augments like iṬ which annul the effect of K/Ṅ (cf. 1.2.18 na ktvā seṭ), C will not be applicable to the base at the following step. These are  cases of unidirectional blocking.  

Most rules (E) which are applicable to finite endings at this stage, are triggered by the type of  lakāra that the ending has replaced, whether that lakāra is marked with Ṭ or Ṅ, the number and  person of the ending, whether the ending is parasmaipada or ātmanepada etc. They do not  block and are not blocked by other rules (for example, see rules 3.4.77 – 3.4.112 of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī). So, we will not focus on them here.

Once the aṅga is ready, we get: 

aṅga + finite ending 

 F G 

The application of F (such as guṇa, vr̥ddhi, samprasāraṇa etc.) is triggered by the existence of  the affix, the first sound of the affix, whether or not it is marked with K / Ṅ etc. Thus, if the  affix undergoes certain changes, F is not applicable at the following step. But G is not triggered  by the last sound of the aṅga. Thus, even if the aṅga undergoes certain changes, G is still  applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking.  

Let us now look at kr̥danta derivations. 

 verbal base + kr̥t affix  

 H I 

The application of H (such as guṇa, samprasāraṇa etc.) is triggered by / depends on the first  sound of the affix, whether it has taken the augment iṬ, whether it is marked with K / Ṅ etc.  Thus, if the affix undergoes certain changes, H is not applicable at the following step. Let us  call H the dependent rule. On the other hand, I is triggered by the first sound of the affix itself  (e.g., 7.2.35 ārdhadhātukasyeḍ valādeḥ) and other factors. Essentially, the application of I is  not dependent on the final sound of the base. So even if the base changes, I is still applicable  at the following step. Let us call I the independent rule. This is a case of unidirectional blocking,  where the independent rule blocks the dependent rule.  

Before we proceed further, notice that, in almost all cases of unidirectional blocking in DOI discussed in the thesis, it is the RHS rule which unidirectionally blocks the LHS rule, and not  vice-versa.62 This is because, it is the RHS rule which is independent and it is the LHS rule  which is dependent. In other words, in almost all cases of unidirectional blocking, the  applicability of the RHS rule does not depend on whether the penultimate or last sound of the  

[^62]: This is exactly why the traditional nitya tool which teaches that the nitya rule defeats the anitya rule,  always correctly resolves cases of DOI conflict involving unidirectional blocking: the nitya rule is  applicable to the RHS operand and the anitya rule to the LHS operand. By (my interpretation of) 1.4.2,  the RHS rule (which is also the nitya rule) defeats the LHS rule (which is the anitya rule).

base changes, but the applicability of the LHS rule does depend on whether the affix is marked  with K / Ṅ, whether it starts with a vowel, whether it has taken the augment iṬ etc. 

Coming back to the larger theme of this section, we see that almost all cases of DOI conflict in  both tiṅanta and kr̥danta derivations involve only unidirectional blocking. This can be  observed in the examples discussed in section 4.3. We rarely come across examples of DOI  conflict that involve mutual blocking. One such exception is example 21 of section 4.3 of this  chapter, which does involve mutual blocking.  

To sum up my observations, we find examples of both mutual and unidirectional blocking in  subanta derivations, but of unidirectional blocking alone in tiṅanta and kr̥danta derivations.  

As seen in this thesis, we find relatively fewer examples of DOI conflict in taddhitānta and  samāsa derivations than we do in subanta, tiṅanta and kr̥danta sections. How can we explain  this phenomenon?  

Let us first answer this question in the context of samāsa derivations. The samāsa template is  ‘[(base1 suP1) (base2 suP2)] + suP3’. suP1 and suP2 are replaced with LUK by 2.4.71 supo  dhātuprātipadikayoḥ. Thus, we are left with ‘base1 base2 + suP3’. Given that the only remaining  affix, i.e., suP3 is also a suP affix, there is almost no scope for any other conflicts to arise apart  from those that can potentially arise in subanta derivations. The only exceptions to this are  those cases wherein the uttarapada can potentially trigger changes in the pūrvapada (see  examples 1 and 8 of section 3.2, chapter 3). This explains why we find very few examples of  DOI conflict which are exclusive to samāsa derivations, i.e., which are not already found in  subanta derivations. 

In taddhitānta derivations too, we find very few examples DOI conflict. Even these examples  are quite similar to each other (see examples 3-7 of section 3.2, chapter 3) and arise because of  the nominal inflection of taddhitānta forms. Why is this the case? The majority of taddhita rules actually teach addition of taddhita affixes, and not any substitutions or modifications. The  taddhita template is ‘(nominal base + suP) + taddhita affix’. suP is replaced with LUK by 2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ. Thus, we are left with ‘nominal base + taddhita affix’. 

nominal base + taddhita affix 

 J L

Taddhita affixes undergo very few, generic changes by rules (L) like by 7.1.2 āyaneyīnīyiyaḥ phaḍhakhacchaghāṁ pratyayādīnām, which are independent of the final sound of the nominal  base. So, any change in the base by rule J cannot block these operations (L) on taddhita affixes.  

The nominal bases preceding taddhita affixes can also undergo certain general changes by rules  (J) such as 7.2.117 taddhiteṣv acām ādeḥ, 7.2.118 kiti ca etc. which do not depend on the first  sound of the taddhita affix for their application, and thus are not blocked by L in case of DOI.  And even those operations (J) such as 6.4.146 or guṇaḥ and 6.4.148 yasyeti ca, which are  triggered by the first sound of the following taddhita affix, are seldom blocked, simply because  the following taddhita affixes themselves undergo very few changes. So, barring replacement  with LUK (see examples 3-7 of section 3.2, chapter 3), most changes in the taddhita affix  cannot block these operations (J) on the nominal base. Since there is little scope for DOI  blocking between J and L, we come across very few examples of DOI conflict in taddhita derivations.
