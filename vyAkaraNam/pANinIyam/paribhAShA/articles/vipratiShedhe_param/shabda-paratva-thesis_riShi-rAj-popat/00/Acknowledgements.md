I want to thank the late Ms. Ranjana Deshpande who, through her enriching and effortless  pedagogy, lit the spark of Sanskrit in me during my high school years. Secondly, I wish to  express my gratitude towards my Guru, Ms. Geeta Gandhi, who initiated me into the  delightful world of Pāṇinian grammar and who, with her wealth of expertise and experience, continues to motivate and inspire me to this day. I am very grateful to Dr. James Benson who  supervised my Masters at the University of Oxford, and whose in-depth, almost spellbinding,  knowledge of the Aṣṭādhyāyī afforded me the opportunity to improve my understanding of its  infrastructure. 

I am most grateful to my supervisor, Dr. Vincenzo Vergiani, whose enlightening insights into  the evolution of the Indian grammatical tradition helped me develop and articulate my thoughts in a cogent manner. I think it would be no exaggeration to say that, were it not for his  perceptiveness, knowledge, wisdom, open-mindedness, magnanimity and liberal attitude, it  would have been absolutely impossible for me to produce this thesis. Right from mentoring  and encouraging me, to having faith in my abilities, to challenging and criticizing me, Dr.  Vergiani did everything that was necessary for me to thrive and flourish at Cambridge. Given  that he has single-handedly overlooked my growth as a researcher for the last four years, he  deserves no less than a lion’s share of credit for this thesis. 

I wish to offer special thanks to Dr. Maria Piera Candotti (University of Pisa), whose  remarkable familiarity with both traditional and modern argumentation on a variety of  derivational issues opened my eyes to multiple new perspectives towards the Aṣṭādhyāyī. I  want to wholeheartedly thank Dr. Balram Shukla (University of Delhi) who, through his  striking knowledge and perspicacity, enabled me to truly appreciate the role of the tradition in  preserving and decoding the Aṣṭādhyāyī. I owe a significant debt of gratitude to Dr. Tanuja  Ajotikar (Assistant Professor, The Sanskrit Library) – who has been nothing short of a living  encyclopaedia on all things Pāṇinian – for helping me appreciate the nuances of traditional  opinions on a wide range of derivational topics. I also want to sincerely thank Prof. Diwakar  Acharya (University of Oxford) and Dr. John Lowe (University of Oxford) for their thoughtful advice on important academic matters.  

I am extremely grateful to faculty members, fellow students and colleagues in Indology and  other fields, with whom I had many opportunities to have stimulating conversations which  facilitated my learning and maturation. I am privileged to enjoy, and very grateful for, the [[6]] unwavering affection and solidarity of my family and friends. Above all, I remain perennially indebted to Bhagavān who has blessed me with the curiosity and enthusiasm that drove this doctoral investigation to fruitful completion.
