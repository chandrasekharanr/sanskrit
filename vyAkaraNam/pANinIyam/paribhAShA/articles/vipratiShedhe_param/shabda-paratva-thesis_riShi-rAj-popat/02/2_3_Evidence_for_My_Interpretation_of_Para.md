title = "2 3 Evidence for My Interpretation of Para"

+++

Before going further, let me provide more evidence to support my interpretation of para. The  meaning of para in 1.4.2 can be confirmed by looking at the meaning of para in the rest of the  Aṣṭādhyāyī. The term para has been used by Pāṇini on many occasions. Its occurrences can be  classified into two groups:

35 

Group A: 1.1.34, 1.4.109, 3.2.39, 3.3.138, 3.4.20, 4.3.5, 5.2.92, 5.3.29, 6.3.8.2 

Group B: 1.1.47, 1.1.51, 1.1.54, 1.1.57, 1.1.70, 1.2.40, 1.4.2, 1.4.62, 1.4.81, 2.1.2, 2.2.31,  2.4.26, 3.1.2, 6.1.84, 6.1.94, 6.1.112, 6.1.115, 6.1.120, 6.2.199, 6.4.156, 7.3.22, 7.3.27, 7.4.80,  7.4.88, 7.4.93, 8.1.2, 8.1.56, 8.2.92, 8.3.4, 8.3.6, 8.3.26, 8.3.27, 8.3.35, 8.3.87, 8.3.110, 8.3.118,  8.4.283, 8.4.58.4 

Let us consider an example from Group A. 1.1.34 pūrva-parāvara-dakṣiṇottarāparādharāṇi  vyavasthāyām asaṁjñāyām (vibhāṣā jasi sarvanāmāni) teaches that the terms pūrva, para etc.  are called sarvanāma optionally when followed by Jas. In 1.1.34 and in the other rules  belonging to Group A, para is used as an ordinary word of the object language Sanskrit. In  these rules, it does not have any special technical connotation with respect to Pāṇini’s  derivational system. We are not interested in Group A, because 1.4.2 belongs to group B. 

Let us consider some examples from Group B. 1.1.47 mid aco’ntyāt paraḥ teaches that an item  marked with anubandha M is placed after, i.e., to the right-hand side of, the last vowel of the  item to which it is added. 1.1.51 ur aṇ raparaḥ teaches that r is added after, i.e., to the right  side of the vowels a, i, u when they are substitutes of r̥. 1.1.54 ādeḥ parasya teaches that a  substitute taught for the following or right-hand side item replaces its first sound. From these  examples, it becomes clear that in the rules I have listed under group B, para is used to mean  ‘right-hand side’ in the context of Pāṇinian derivations.  

Furthermore, we also see that in the Aṣṭādhyāyī the term pūrva, the antonym of para, when  used specifically in the context of Pāṇinian derivations, means LHS. For example, consider the  pair of rules 1.1.66 tasminn iti nirdiṣṭe pūrvasya and 1.1.67 tasmād ity uttarasya.   

[^2]: Since our focus is not on this group, I have not listed certain rules in which we find compounds or  secondary derivatives containing para. Examples include parasmaipada, parokṣa, aparokṣa, parovara, parama, and paraspara. 

[^3]: The original rule is upasargād anotparaḥ, but Patañjali has suggested that it should be read as  upasargād bahulam. We find the latter version in many recensions. 

[^4]: See Appendix F for the list of sūtras.

1.1.66 teaches  that when an item is taught (nirdiṣṭe) in the locative (tasminn iti), it means that the item to its  left-hand side (pūrvasya) undergoes an operation, and 1.1.67 teaches that, when an item is taught in the ablative (tasmād iti), it means that the item to its right-hand side (uttarasya)[^5] undergoes the operation6.  

Let us confirm this by considering some rules which contain both pūrva and para. 6.1.84 ekaḥ pūrvaparayoḥ teaches that (in the following rules) a single sound replaces both the LHS sound  and the RHS sound in case of saṁhitā ‘immediate proximity’. Similarly, 1.1.57 acaḥ parasmin  pūrvavidhau teaches that a substitute for a vowel, if it is conditioned by an RHS context, is  treated like its substituendum with respect to an operation on an LHS element. 

Besides, the word kāryam in 1.4.2 also gives us some crucial information. We know that in the  Aṣṭādhyāyī, Pāṇini does not generally use finite verbal forms in his rules. For example, in  6.1.77, he does not say iko yaṇ aci bhavati / kāryam, but simply iko yaṇ aci. So, in the case of  1.4.2 too, we can safely interpret kāryam as a noun rather than interpreting it as an optative  passive participle meaning ‘should be done’. What does the noun kārya generally mean? It  means ‘operation’, not ‘rule’. If Pāṇini wanted to say what the tradition interprets him as saying,  I think he would have simply said vipratiṣedhe paraṁ sūtram and not vipratiṣedhe paraṁ 

kāryam. All this corroborates my interpretation of para in 1.4.2.  

Let me summarize this topic now. In ordinary speech, para means ‘following, something that  lies after’. Accordingly, in 1.4.2, para actually means ‘that which comes after’ in the left-to right sense in the context of derivations. However, the tradition took it as ‘that which comes  after’ in the top (first)-to-bottom (last) or beginning-to-end sense in the context of the serial  order of rules. And so, while para in 1.4.2 refers to the operand or operation that lies after, or  on the right-hand side relative to another operand or operation, the tradition misunderstood it  as the rule which comes after the other rule in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. 


[^5]: Here uttara is a synonym of para. 

[^6]: These are the traditional interpretations of these two rules. I discuss my interpretations of them in  Appendix B.  

[^7]: While I will discuss this in detail in chapter 6, I must mention here that Kātyāyana mentions that para in 1.4.2 could mean ‘RHS’ in vt. 12 on 6.1.158 anudāttaṁ padam ekavarjam. He says:  śāstraparavipratiṣedhāniyamād vā śabdaparavipratiṣedhāt siddham ‘[in the event of vipratiṣedha between two operations] because it has not been [explicitly] mandated that paratva of rules [alone should be used to resolve] vipratiṣedha, alternatively paratva of sounds [may also be used to]  accomplish [the task of resolving] vipratiṣedha’ (Mbh III.100.12).

This leads to an important question: if traditional scholars interpreted para as ‘RHS  item/operation’ in so many metarules as shown above, why did they interpret it as ‘the  following rule’ in 1.4.2?[^7] I think this misunderstanding possibly arose because another metarule, 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham, uses pūrva, the opposite of para, to mean ‘preceding rule’.+++(5)+++  8.2.1 teaches that from 8.2.1 onwards, a preceding rule treats a following rule as suspended.  This may have led Kātyāyana, the first scholar to comment upon Pāṇini’s sūtras, to think that,  in sūtras dealing with relationships between rules such as 8.2.1 and 1.4.2, pūrva and para mean  preceding rule and following rule respectively. However, upon closer examination, one realizes  that when Pāṇini wants to indicate that he is referring to the relationship between preceding  and following rules rather than operands, he adds the affix traL8 to the base: he says pūrva-tra in 8.2.1.9 This topic deserves our meticulous attention, and we will discuss it in greater detail  in chapter 5. Here is the summary of my comprehensive solution: 

Same Step Rule Interaction (SSRI)[^10] 

- Type 1 (SOI) 
  - the exception rule wins
- Type 2 (DOI = vipratiṣedha ‘mutual opposition’) 
  - RHS (para) operation wins 


[^8]: 5.3.10 saptamyās tral.

[^9]: Pūrvatra stands for ‘with respect to a rule which comes earlier in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order’.  

[^10]: As stated before, by ‘rule’, here I specifically mean vidhi sūtra ‘operational rule’.
