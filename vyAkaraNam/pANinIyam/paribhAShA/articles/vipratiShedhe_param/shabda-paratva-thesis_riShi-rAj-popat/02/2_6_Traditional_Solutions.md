Now let us look at how the tradition solves examples of conflict. As stated in the previous  chapter, traditional scholars tried to use their interpretation of 1.4.2 (the rule that comes later  in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī wins the conflict) to resolve such conflicts. This often gave  them the wrong answer, so in order to reduce the challenges posed by their interpretation of  1.4.2, they significantly reduced the scope of applicability of 1.4.2. 

They achieved this by restricting the meaning of vipratiṣedha to tulyabalavirodha ‘conflicts between rules of equal strength’. So, 1.4.2 does not apply to pairs of conflicting rules if the two  rules are not of equal strength. In the case of such pairs of unequal strength, the rule which is

stronger than the other wins. The tradition has come up with certain methods to identify these  pairs of unequal strength. While we have already looked at some of them in the previous  chapter, I will briefly discuss them below to outline which tool is used to deal with what kind  of interaction (SOI / DOI) and what kind of blocking (unidirectional / mutual).16 

1. nitya > anitya: in a conflict between two rules A and B, A is called nitya with respect to B  if A is applicable (both before and) after the application of B. B is called anitya with respect to  A if B is applicable before but not after the application of A. The nitya rule A is stronger than  and defeats the anitya rule B. In other words, A wins against B if A unidirectionally blocks B. 

2. antaraṅga > bahiraṅga: according to the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, ‘antaraṅga is (a rule) the  causes (of the application) of which lie within (or before) the sum of the causes of a bahiraṅga rule’.17 Note that this tool is seldom used to solve actual cases of conflict and is mostly only  used to solve what I call cases of pseudo-conflict. We will delve into this in Appendix C. 

3. apavāda > utsarga: an exception rule, or a more specific rule, defeats the general rule. 

4. pūrvavipratiṣiddha: when applying 1.4.2 gives the wrong answer, Kātyāyana comes up with  pūrvavipratiṣiddha vārttikas. These state that in certain cases, contrary to what is taught by the  traditional interpretation of 1.4.2, it is not the para rule (the rule which comes after the other  rule in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī), but instead the pūrva rule (the rule that comes before  the other rule in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī) that wins. Pūrvavipratiṣiddha too has come  to be used like a conflict resolution tool. Here are two well-known examples of such vārttikas  (vt. 10 and 1118 respectively on 7.1.96 striyāṁ ca): 

[^16]: In the previous chapter I have discussed the hierarchy of these rules (Pbh 38 of the  Paribhāṣenduśekhara), so I do not discuss it here again. This hierarchy is not of much consequence,  practically speaking.

a. vt. 10 guṇavr̥ddhyauttvatr̥jvadbhāvebhyo num pūrvavipratiṣiddham: in case of vipratiṣedha,  the pūrva sūtra, which teaches the insertion of the augment nUM, takes precedence over para  sūtras which teach (i) guṇa19, (ii) vr̥ddhi20, (iii) auttva21, (iv) tr̥jvadbhāva22. 

b. vt. 11 numaciratr̥jvadbhāvebhyo nuṭ (pūrvavipratiṣiddham): in case of vipratiṣedha, the  pūrva sūtra, which teaches the insertion of the augment nUṬ23 takes precedence over para  sūtras which teach (i) numāgama ‘insertion of augment nUM’24, (ii) replacement with r when  followed by a vowel (aC)25, (iii) tr̥jvadbhāva26.  

5. niravakāśa / anavakāśa > sāvakāśa27: In his first vārttika28 on 1.4.2, Kātyāyana defines  vipratiṣedha as a conflict which arises between two sāvakāśa rules: dvau prasaṅgāv anyārthāv  ekasmin sa vipratiṣedhaḥ ‘[When] two rules [which are] applicable elsewhere (i.e., in other  derivations) [become applicable] at the same place, this [situation is called] vipratiṣedha’. But  when one of the two rules is niravakāśa, that is, when it does not have scope to apply elsewhere,  such a conflict is not called vipratiṣedha. In such cases, the niravakāśa rule is thought to be  stronger than the sāvakāśa rule. The niravakāśa rule wins. 

As discussed in the previous chapter, the tradition does not apply these tools consistently, and  often, applying some of these tools gives the wrong form. Nonetheless, through the table  presented below, I try to give a broad and general overview of the tools that are used to deal  with different kinds of conflicts:

Lastly, alongside these tools, the tradition liberally uses (its interpretation of) 1.4.2 to deal with  all kinds of conflict when it is necessary and / or desirable to do so.
