A practical guide to Svaras in Vedic recitation  

## Vedic accents and their vocal rendering
Udātta-s(U) are marked in red in this article. This is the natural or inherent accent in a word. Traditionally it is rendered as middle pitch. Udātta may be signaled especially in ṚV and AV traditions by raising the hand. Hence, Pāṇini’s sūtra on Udātta (उच्चैरु दात्तः | 1.2.29) originally meant that the arm was raised rather than the pitch being raised (as commonly understood by many). +++(V: Disagree)+++

Frequently it is left unmarked in vedic texts. In texts of certain śākhā-s, like certain kaṭha manuscripts, it is the only marked Svara and shown as a vertical over-bar.

The same convention is also used to mark the Udātta in printed texts of the ṚV-khila. In this case the remaining accents must be derived from the Udātta using the below rules or using the oral tradition where
available. In the ŚYV, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (including Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad) it is marked by a single
horizontal under bar. This later text is recited in a special bhāṣika fashion where no other Svara-s than the
Udātta are tonally expressed, with special deep low tones for certain clustered Udātta series.
Svarita (S) is rendered in high pitch on short vowel. In ṚV, AV, and ŚYV-Kāṇva all long vowel Svarita-s are
rendered as an elongation or duplication in an elevated pitch. In KṛYV only those long vowel Svarita-s that are
prior to consonants are rendered as an elongation or duplication. Additionally in the KṛYV the anunāsika-s
with Svarita-s, long Kampa-s (see below) and long vowel Svarita prior to the daṇḍa mark (|) are rendered as an
elongation or duplication. Further, anunāsika-s adjacent to a consonant cluster (e.g. ति״मन्-Ɋस॒हसर् ॑ शाखे) are also
similarly elongated in KṛYV. In the Maitrāyanīya śākhā of the KṛYV the terminal long Svarita next to a daṇḍa
are further decorated by extended elongation. In most texts the Svarita is marked with a vertical overbar. In
most southern Taittirīya texts the vertical double bar is used to indicate Svarita -s that are intoned in an
elongated or duplicate way. In certain Maitrāyaṇīya śākhā manuscripts they may be indicated by an under dot
or vertical triple over bars.
Anudātta (A) is rendered in low pitch. It is most commonly marked by a horizontal under-bar across many
texts.
All other syllables are rendered in middle tone. A series of middle tone syllable comprise an Ekaśruti segment.
In the Sāmaveda the Svara-s are marked by the numbers: १ for २ for and ३. However, most receiters do not
render these tontal in samh recitation. Of course they have a distinctive 7-tontal system for the Sāmagana-s. I am not
also discussing the Madhyaṃdina ŚYV Svara-s because, despite their complex notation and hand gestures, the
modern reciters have largely lost its original tonality [Interestingly, I have heard a short excerpt of Nepāli
chanter of the Madhyaṃdina ŚYV who appeared to preserve more realistic intonations; unfortunately this was
a single exception to all the many Madhyaṃdina reciters I have heard over the years]. The AV-Paippalāda has
also lost its Svara-s in modern Orissan recitation, though Lokeśa Candra had manuscripts of the Kaśmirian
Paippalāda that did have partially preserved Svara-s indicated by upper and lower vertical bars. The Nambudiri
ṚVrecitation is the most divergent of all surviving recitation styles. The Nambudiri chanter does not match the
marked Svara-s of any of the other traditions (except for the Kampa which he similarly renders; see below).
The Nambudiri alone utters certain Udātta-s in high pitch and elongates or duplicates long vowel Svarita -s
when it is sandwiched between two Anudātta-s. He also adds an additional triplication of the terminal syllables
in the case of long vowels and anunāsika-s. Given that Nambudiri-s as Pūrvaśikhā Brāhmaṇa-s represent an
early branch of Brahminical settlers in the Dravidian regions, this extremely divergent style might represent
an evolutionary long-branch effect or might represent the only survival of an original Southern recitation
tradition.
The Udātta is the natural accent of a word and is the inherent property of the Vedic language. Once it is
marked all the other intonations of the Saṃhitā or Padapāṭha may be derived from it using the rules of Pāṇini.
This Udātta accent is usually conserved for a Vedic word of a certain form. For example the Udātta accent of
the word अिग्नः (on the second syllable) is preserved throughout its occurrences in the ṚV and also applies for its
derivatives, which preserve a similar form, like:
अिग्नम ् | अिग्न ना | अिग्नर ् | अग्न े र्
However, its shortened derivatives may assume a different accent (where the Udātta shifts to the first
syllable):
अग्न े |अग्न |
Or in some contexts it may become accent-less:
अग्न े | अग्न
Given the presence of natural accents even in Greek, these accents are likely to have been present in the proto-
Indo-European common ancestor and correspond to the Udātta in Vedic Sanskrit. Several words Greek,
Lithuanian and Sanskrit share a common natural accent. Greek tonal terms like oxu- high pitch; perispomene-
a double toned rendering; baru- low pitch suggest that ancient Greek was tonally rendered comparable to
Vedic Sanskrit. The position of the Udātta affects meaning of a word in Sanskrit in compound forms. Example:
सुकृत= well done; सुकृत= good deed
Rules for determination of other accents from U
Rule #1
When there is an Udātta on a syllable the syllable before it becomes Anudātta and the syllable after it becomes
Svarita i.e. X-U-X=> A-U-S
Example:
अिग्न ना रियम् अश्नवत ् | applying the above rule becomes:
अ॒िग्नना ॑ र॒ियम् अ॑श्नवत ् |
The same rule applies for the individual words in a Padapāṭha. Thus for the above the Padapāṭha would be:
अ॒िग्नना ॑ । र॒ियम् । अश्नवत ् ।
Rule #2
When there is no Udātta throughout an initial set of syllables in a sentence then they all acquire an Anudātta till
the first Udātta is encountered i.e. X-X...n-U=> A-A...n-U
Example:
सुरुपक ृ त्न ु म् becomes:
सु॒रु ॒ प॒कृ॒त्न ु म्
Rule # 3
When an originally unaccented syllable is sandwiched between an upstream Udātta syllable and a downstream
Udātta or Svarita syllable then it becomes an Anudātta syllable i.e. U-X-U=>U-A-U
Example:
यद् अङ्ग दाशुशे त्व म् becomes:
यद् अ॒ङ्ग दा ॒ शुशे॒ त्व म ्
Rule #4
When Udātta-s come in succession they all remain middle tone, Ekaśruti. U-U...n=>U-U...n
Example:
अ״मान् सु ततर् becomes (of course the other rules are also in action):
अ॒״मान् सु ततर् 
Rule #5
A Kampa Svarita emerges in the following conditions:
Kṣaipra clause:
When two Udātta sandwich an accentless syllable at the junction of two words which result in a saṃdhi with a
half vowel (ya, ra, la, va) then a Kampa Svarita is formed.
Example:
मक्ष ु इРथा becomes (of course the other rules are also in action):
म॒॒िɗवРथा
This Kampa is a hrasva Kampa and is denoted by a  in ṚVand AV texts. In KṛYV-Taittirīya Saṃhitā and ŚYV-
Kāṇva Saṃhitā they are denoted and rendered just as other short vowel Svarita -s. In the ṚV and AV their
recitation is thus: First recite the Kampa syllable as in a musical low tone, and then recite the separate
consonantless vowel in a middle tone.
Praśliṣṭa clause:
When two Udātta-s sandwich an accentless syllable at the junction of two words which results in a saṃdhi that
elides the accentless syllable and forms a new syllable then a Kampa Svarita is formed.
Example:
न एव becomes:
नैव
This Kampa is a dīrgha Kampa and is denoted by a  in ṚV and AV texts. In KṛYV-Taittirīya saṃhitā and ŚYV-
Kāṇva Saṃhitā they are denoted and rendered just as other long vowel Svarita -s. In the ṚV and AV their
recitation is thus: First recite the pre-syllable as in a musical low tone, then recite the separate consonantless
vowel in a low tone and finally recite the separate consonantless vowel in the middle tone.
Abhinihita clause:
When two Udātta-s sandwich an accentless syllable at the junction of two words which results in a saṃdhi that
causes the absorption of a pre-Udātta अ by an ओ or ए formed by a saṃdhi then a dīrgha Kampa Svarita is
formed is formed on the neomorphic ओ or ए.
Example:
राय अविनः becomes by saṃdhi rule and rule #1: रा॒योऽविनः Then the Abhinihita clause applies and it becomes:
रा॒योविनः
It is recited like other dīrgha Kampa-s.
The clauses for Jātya Svarita -s
When an ancestral Udātta bearing syllable is innately lost due to certain natural saṃdhi-s (an innate version of
the Kṣaipra clause) then such syllables come with a Svarita tone.
Example:
तनुवामहे usually exists as तन्वाम हे hence the न् वा has a jātya Svarita . Thus applying the above rules we get:
त॒न्वा  म॒हे
It is recited like any other Svarita depending on whether a short or long vowel is generated by the saṃdhi. In
the AV-Śaunaka a special symbol ‘’ is used to depict such Svarita -s, i.e.: त॒न्वाम ॒ हे. In certain manuscripts of
the Kaṭha and Maitrāyaṇīya śākhā these Svarita -s may be indicated by signs under the text.
If a jātya Svarita generated by the above rule is further absorbed in a saṃdhi with another syllable then a
dīrgha Kampa is generated.
Example:
कु-अ इदानीं =(jātya Svarita )=> क्व  इ॒दानीं  =(saṃdhi)=> क्व े दानीं 
Other tonal modifications
In rare cases a syllable may be marked by a २ or ३ sign in the Saṃhitāpāṭha. In such cases the syllable has to
be lengthened by that many morae.
Example:
िस्व  दा॒सी ३ दु॒पिर िस्वदासी ३ त् || (ṚV10.129.4cd)
