By the time of patanjali (classical saMskRta) the ‡§è ‡§ì were monophthongs, but ‡§ê ‡§î were diphthongs:

So that half e' and 'half o' may not be used when the rules relating to the shortening of long vowels operate.

Oh! this has to be read even when one reads the diphthongs with at the end. The two letters which come under the pratyaharu are diphthongs having one matra for a and another matra for i or u. Hence when rules relating to shortening operate, sometimes a may be substituted and sometimes i or u. They have to avoid the substitution of a.

> I don't know about the RgvedaprAtishAkhya or the Rktantra - they would be prior to patanjali, but also when classical sanskrit had come to be spoken... patanjali (already classical) mentions that people from the ‡§∞‡§æ‡§£‡§æ‡§Ø‡§£‡•Ä‡§Ø stream pronounced a short version of ‡§è. A short length vowel pretty much cannot be a diphthong. If this sect had been pronouncing a short version of ‡§è since ancient times, that would argue against a diphthong ‡§è.

> In PƒÅ·πáini's time the *ƒÅi > ai & *ai > e (also *ƒÅu > au & *au > o) chain shifts had not yet happened in sanskrit (which with its several dialects, was the commonly spoken bhƒÅ·π£ƒÅ of the day, even after being standardised by PƒÅ·πáini).

> Also to the redactors of the Pali canon who (living not too distant from PƒÅ·πáini in time) were very likely not schooled in phonetics or morphology, the *ƒÅi and *ai would have sounded too similar to need separate ak·π£aras in the script so both were represented by the same letter ëÄè (brƒÅhmƒ´ symbol for 'e'). Thus while devai·∏• was pronounced *daivƒÅi·∏• by PƒÅ·πáini, it was pronounced in much the same way by the redactors of the pali canon, but written as devehi (where both e were expected to approximate the unified ai phoneme of the unschooled person.
